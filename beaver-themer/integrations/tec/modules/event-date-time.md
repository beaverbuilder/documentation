The Event Date & Time module is based on the Beaver Builder [Text Editor module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/text). It uses an instance of the classic WordPress editor and automatically inserts the [`the_events_calendar_date_and_time`](../field-connections.md#event-date-and-time) field connection into the text area, as shown in the image below.

## Availability

The Event Date & Time module appears in **The Events Calendar** section of the **Themer modules** group in the Content Panel when you're editing a [Singular-type](../../../layout-types-modules/singular-layout-type/themer-singular-layout-type.md) Themer layout.

## Style tab

The **Style** tab has a variety of settings that apply to the [`the_events_calendar_date_and_time`](../field-connections.md#event-date-and-time) field connection and any other text in the module, such as text color and the Beaver Builder [Typography section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md), which gives you many choices not available in the text editor, starting with font family.

## The Advanced tab

There are all the usual [Advanced tab](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab) settings for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
