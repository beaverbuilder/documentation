## Availability

The Event Export Links module appears in **The Events Calendar** section of the **Themer modules** group in the Content Panel when you're editing a [Singular-type](../../../layout-types-modules/singular-layout-type/themer-singular-layout-type.md) Themer layout.

## Style tab

The **Style** tab has four options:

* **Alignment**. This setting horizontally aligns both export links you can align left, center, and right.
* **Text Color**. Set the text color for the export links.
* **Background Color**. Set the fill color for the module.
* **Border Radius**. Set the border radius using pixel. The one value will effect all four corners.

## The Advanced tab

There are all the usual [Advanced tab](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab) settings for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
