The Product Upsells module is in the **WooCommerce modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type layout in Beaver Themer and you've assigned a single product page as the location.

If you have selected products for the **Up-sells** field on the **Linked Products** tab for your product, they are displayed with the heading **You may also like...**

If there aren't any upsells specified for a product, the module is not displayed  in published output. If you preview a product in the Themer layout that doesn't have any upsells associated with it, you'll see the placeholder `woocommerce_upsell_display`.

## Module settings

This module has only an **Advanced** tab, on which you can customize margins, responsive layout, visibility, animation, and assign an ID or class name.
