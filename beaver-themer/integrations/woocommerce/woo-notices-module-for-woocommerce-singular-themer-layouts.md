The Woo Notices module is in the WooCommerce modules category of Themer layouts, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type layout in Beaver Themer and you've assigned a single product page as the location.

The Woo Notices module lets you reposition WooCommerce notices from the default position at the top of the product listing to any other location in your Themer layout. In the following example, the Woo Notices module was placed above the Add to Cart Button module in a Singular layout.
