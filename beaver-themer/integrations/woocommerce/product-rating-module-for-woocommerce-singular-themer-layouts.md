The Product Rating module is in the **WooCommerce modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type layout in Beaver Themer and you've assigned a single product page as the location.

If you have reviews enabled for the product displayed, this module displays the number of customer reviews. It also displays the average customer rating, displayed in stars, if you have enabled ratings in your WooCommerce settings. In the following screenshot, both reviews and ratings have been enabled for this product.

The initial Themer layout includes a Product Rating module. When you preview\ products that don't have any customer reviews or ratings to display, you'll see the `woocommerce_single_template_rating` placeholder.
