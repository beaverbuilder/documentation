The Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin provides a way to add more data to your pages, posts, and custom post types in WordPress. With Beaver Themer, you can use field connections to retrieve the data of custom fields you have created with ACF ([free](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) or [premium](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)) plugin.

:::info
Field connections are available not only in Beaver Themer layouts, but also in Beaver Builder layouts, provided that Beaver Themer is installed.
