You might get a message that a certain type of Themer layout is Unsupported in two different situations:

  * You are creating a new Themer layout  
  ![](/img/why-does-my-themer-layout-say-unsupported-52155a7a.png)
  * You have one or more existing Themer layouts and the Unsupported label suddenly appears.  
  ![](/img/why-does-my-themer-layout-say-unsupported-d8d101a3.png)

This happens because you're using a theme that doesn't support that type of Themer layout.

If you want to use that Themer layout, you'll have to switch to [a theme that supports it](/beaver-themer/management-compatibility/beaver-themer-supported-themes.md), or in some cases you can [add code so your theme will support it](/beaver-themer/developer/add-header-footer-and-parts-support-to-your-theme-themer.md).
