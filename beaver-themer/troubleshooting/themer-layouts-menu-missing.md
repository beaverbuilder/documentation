If the Themer Layouts menu item isn't available under the Beaver Builder menu in your WordPress Admin Dashboard, it's typically due to one of the following reasons:

- **The Beaver Themer plugin isn't installed.**  
  Beaver Themer is an add-on plugin designed for use with the premium version of Beaver Builder. If the Themer Layouts menu item doesn't appear, it indicates that you haven't installed the Beaver Themer plugin.

- **Insufficient User Access.**  
  If you've installed Beaver Themer but still can't locate the Themer Layouts menu in your WordPress Admin Dashboard, you should review the Beaver Builder [User Access settings](/beaver-builder/settings/user-access#themer-layout-editing).

  By default, the Themer Layouts menu item is visible only to users with the **Administrator** role. To allow other users access to the **Themer Layouts** menu, you can grant them the **Themer Layouts Editor** capability, which permits users to edit and manage Themer layouts.
