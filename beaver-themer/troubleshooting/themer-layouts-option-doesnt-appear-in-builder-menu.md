If you can't find Themer layouts in the Builder menu, it's almost always due to one of two reasons:

* You don't have the Beaver Themer plugin installed.  
The Beaver Themer plugin is a premium plugin that requires the Page Builder plugin to work. After you install Beaver Themer, you'll automatically see a Themer layouts option in the Builder menu.

* You don't have the Builder menu enabled.
If you do have Beaver Themer installed but you can't find the Builder menu in the WordPress admin panel, see our [Can't find the Beaver Builder menu in the admin panel](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/cant-find-the-beaver-builder-menu-in-the-admin-panel.md) about how to enable it.
