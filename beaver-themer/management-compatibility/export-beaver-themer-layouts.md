You can export Themer layouts built with Beaver Themer, either the entire set or selected Themer layouts. This is done using **Tools > Export**, as shown in the following screenshot.

The procedure is the same as for exporting Beaver Builder layout templates. See the [article about exporting layout templates](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/export-import-content.md) to get more details about how to export.
