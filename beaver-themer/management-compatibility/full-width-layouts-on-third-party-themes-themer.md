If you use a third-party theme with Beaver Themer you may need to add some additional CSS to get your layouts to be full width. A full-width layout spans the entire width of the page from edge to edge.

Here's something you can try.

First, find the ID or class name of your themeâ€™s content wrapper. If you look at the HTML source for a page, the content wrapper is usually a `<div>` tag that occurs after the header block, and it often uses an ID or class with the selector`content`, for example:

```html
<div id="content">
```

Next, write a rule for the CSS class of the type of layout you want full width with that content wrapper ID or class inside it.

For Singular layouts use `.fl-theme-builder-singular`
For Archive layouts use `.fl-theme-builder-archive`
For 404 layouts use `.fl-theme-builder-404`

If `id="content"` is the selector for your content wrapper, then the rule would look like this:

```css
.fl-theme-builder-singular #content,
.fl-theme-builder-archive #content,
.fl-theme-builder-404 #content {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    max-width: none;
    width: auto;
}
```

See the article on [where to put custom CSS code](/beaver-builder/styles/custom-code.md).
