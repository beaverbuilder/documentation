Welcome to the Beaver Themer documentation. This serves as a go-to resource, providing in-depth explanations, step-by-step instructions, and practical examples to help you harness the full potential of Beaver Themer.

## What is Beaver Themer?

The Beaver Themer plugin is an add-on for the Beaver Builder page builder plugin. While Beaver Builder focuses on building custom content layouts for individual pages and posts, Beaver Themer allows you to create theme layout templates and apply them to various parts of your website, such as headers, footers, single post templates, archive pages, and more.

With Beaver Themer, you can design and customize your website's overall appearance and structure, including dynamic content using field connections and advanced layout options. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to visually create and edit theme layout templates without requiring coding knowledge.
