Beaver Themer 1.5 includes the following new features and improvements.

## Better Compatibility with Full Site Editing Themes

Your Themer layouts will work with Full Site Editing Themes.

## Conditional Logic Improvements

You can now move rules from one group to another via drag and drop, duplicate a rule and bulk delete rules.

## UI for adding Singular Layouts to Page Template Dropdown

This is already possible with code but this adds a field when editing Singular layouts for you to do this without code.

## Previewing a Post/Page

There is now a search in the Preview As section so you can quickly find the post or page you want to preview.
