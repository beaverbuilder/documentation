Beaver Themer 1.5 includes the following new features and improvements.

::: info
Please note that Themer 1.5 requires Beaver Builder version 2.9+.
:::

## New Features

### The Loop Module

The _Loop_ module is a container module that accepts child modules. However, unlike the _Box_ module, the Loop module will repeat its child modules for each item in the query as defined in the settings, allowing you to build truly custom loop layouts requiring you to build them in the Post Module custom layout section.

It currently supports the same type of queries as our Posts module and ACF repeaters.

## What's Still to Come For 1.5

### Full Site Editing Theme Support

Your Themer layouts will work with Full Site Editing Themes.

## UI for adding Singular Layouts to Post/Page Template Dropdown

This is already possible with code but a new field will be added for Singular layouts to allow for it to be done without code.
