Beaver Themer 1.4 includes the following new features and improvements.
## Layout enhancements

### Singular layouts can have Beaver Builder layouts in the post content area

You can now have both a Singular Beaver Themer layout and a Beaver Builder layout in the content area of the same post. This is illustrated in the following screenshot. The Themer Singular layout usually includes a Post Content module, into which the post content is dynamically inserted. The post content itself is created with the WordPress editor, or, as of Beaver Themer 1.4, with the Beaver Builder editor. In the screenshot, the post content area was created with a Beaver Builder layout, containing a Text Editor module and a Photo module in two columns.

By default, Beaver Builder layouts for post or page content override Singular Themer layouts, so there's an extra step involved if you assign a Singular Themer layout to a page or post with a Beaver Builder layout. See the [Singular layout page](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/singular-layout-type/themer-singular-layout-type.md/#extra-step-for-singular-layouts-with-beaver-builder-layouts-in-the-content-area) for more information.

### Header layouts: Set the breakpoint for sticky headers

The Themer Header layout has a **Sticky** setting that in previous releases applied only to large devices. You can now choose which breakpoints it applies in the **Sticky breakpoint** setting.

For more information about how the **Sticky**, **Shrink**, and **Overlay** settings work together, see the article about [Themer Header layouts](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/header-layout-type/themer-header-layout-type.md/#sticky-shrink-and-overlay-settings).

### Header layouts: four new layout templates

When you create a Themer layout, a layout template is automatically assigned. You can change the layout template by opening the Content panel and clicking the **Templates** tab. By default, the **Header 1** layout template is assigned, but you can select any of Headers 2-5, as shown in this screenshot:

![Header Themer layout templates in the Content panel](/img/themer-header-templates.png)

See the article about [Themer Header layouts](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/header-layout-type/themer-header-layout-type.md/#choose-a-themer-header-layout-template) for more information about each template.

### Footer layouts: four new layout templates

Themer Footer layouts also have four new layout templates on the **Templates** tab of the content panel, as shown in this screenshot:

![Footer Themer layout templates in the Content panel](/img/themer-footer-templates.png)

See the article about [Themer Footer layouts](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/footer-layout-type/themer-footer-layout-type.md/#choose-a-themer-footer-layout-template) for more information about each template.

## Themer Module enhancements

### Post Navigation module

The Post Navigation module has a number of new options and a new **Style** tab. See the [Post Navigation Module article](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/singular-layout-type/themer-singular-layout-post-navigation-module.md) for details.

### New: Woo Notices module for Singular layouts

There is a new Woo Notices module for Singular layouts that displays standard WooCommerce notices such as the following:

![Beaver Themer 1.4 new Woo Notices module enhancements](/img/themer-1-4-features-10.png)

This module lets you style the text and background color of the notices and place them in any position in your Themer Singular product layout.

For more information see the article about the [Woo Notices module](../integrations/woocommerce/woo-notices-module-for-woocommerce-singular-themer-layouts.md).

### WooCommerce Add to Cart Button module enhancements

#### New Add to Cart button hover colors

In Singular Themer layouts, you can set hover colors in the Add to Cart Button module in the **Themer Modules** group:

![WooCommerce](/img/themer-1-4-features-8.jpg)

See the article about the [WooCommerce Add to Cart Button](/beaver-themer/integrations/woocommerce/add-to-cart-button-module-for-woocommerce-singular-themer-layouts.md)

#### WooCommerce Wishlists plugin integration

If you have the [WooCommerce Wishlists plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-wishlists/), then the **Add to Cart** module in Singular Themer layouts includes an **Add to wishlist** button, as shown in this screenshot.

![WooCommerce Wishlists plugin, Add to Wishlist button](/img/themer-1-4--about--wc-wishlist.png)

## New HTML classes for third-party integrations

### WooCommerce: class for products on sale

When a product is on sale, the WooCommerce single product page with a Singular Themer layout adds a `sale` class to the HTML output, as follows:

![WooCommerce added HTML sale class in singular layouts for products on sale](/img/themer-1-4--about--wc-sale-class--4.png)

This class is useful if you want to add custom CSS to single products on sale.

### The Events Calendar: single event class

For Themer Singular layouts, the `tribe-events-single` class is added to the HTML output for single event pages. This is useful if you want to add custom CSS to single event pages.

## Field connection enhancements

### Expanded ability to test for values in fields

The ability to test for values in field connections was previously limited to certain data types in custom fields. You can now test for values in standard fields. For example, you could test for a specific title for a standard post and display something as a result. 

Another example: you could check for a specific term assigned to the post. Suppose you have a standard category with the value `News` and the slug `news-cat`. The following shortcode tests for the presence of this category on a particular post. 

```
[wpbb-if post:terms_list taxonomy='category' display='slug' limit='1' linked='no' exp='equals' value='news-cat']
The result here is what's displayed if the post is in the News category.
[/wpbb-if]
```

The easiest way to construct the conditional field connection shortcode is to follow this procedure:

1. Create a field connection shortcode in a Beaver Builder module in the usual way: click the Plus icon, choose the options to create the shortcode, and click **Insert**.
2. Change the `[wpbb` at the beginning of the shortcode to `[wpbb-if`
3. After the right bracket at the end of the shortcode, add the text you want to display if the statement is true, followed by [/wpbb-if]`.
3. In the [wpbb-if] open tag, add an `exp=' '` attribute to indicate the operator.  
Usually, you're doing a text comparison using `equals`, or `notequals`.
4. Add a `value=' '` attribute to indicate the value you're looking for.

For example, here's a standard field connection shortcode to insert a post title:

```
[wpbb post:title]
```

Here's a conditional shortcode constructed from that:

```html
[wpbb-if post:title exp="equals" value="My funky post"]
Yeah, this is my funky post!
[/wpbb-if]
```

If the post title is "My funky post" then here is what's displayed on the page: "Yeah, this is my funky post!".

### Additional support for Advanced Custom Fields field connections

#### Dropdown selection of ACF fields

When you choose any ACF field category as a field connection or insert (post, archive, and so on), there's a **Detected Fields** dropdown list of ACF fields to choose from. Choosing a field from this list autopopulates the **Field type** and **Field name** settings, as shown in this screenshot.

![](/img/themer-1-4-features-7.png)

Using **Detected fields** is optional. You can continue to select the field type and type in the field name slug manually.

#### Support for ACF Taxonomy fields

You can now use a field connection or field connection shortcode to list the items selected in an ACF Taxonomy field.

In this example, the WooCommerce Products taxonomy was used in an ACF Taxonomy field and assigned to single posts, so that products could be featured in a blog and related to product categories. Then a field connection shortcode was added in a module in a Themer Singular layout to display the product terms selected for any particular post, as shown in the following screenshot.

![Example of an ACF Taxonomy field in a Themer Singular layout](/img/themer-1-4-features-5.jpg)

To set up the field connection or shortcode, use a module with text output, such as a Text Editor or HTML module, or even a module with a text field such as a Heading module. When you click the Plus sign to insert the field connection, choose **ACF Relational**, shown in this screenshot: 

![To insert a Taxonomy field, choose ACF Relational](/img/themer-1-4-features-4.png)

Then in the settings, specify the slug for your ACF Taxonomy field. You can type it into the **Field name** setting or simply select it from the **Detected fields** list, shown in the screenshot below. In the **List type** setting, choose how you want your terms list to appear.

![ACF Taxonomy field - field connection settings](/img/themer-1-4-features-6.png)

#### Expanded support for ACF True/False field types

**True/false** is now listed as a field type when you're adding a field connection. After you select that field type, the settings panel that you see next has an option to enter a custom value for **True** (the default is **1**) or **False** (the default is **0**).

#### New support for the ACF Button Group  field type

When you click an ACF category from the list of eligible field connections, choose  **Button group** as the **Field type** or choose a Button Group field from the **Detected Fields** list.

#### Field connection support for the Smart Slider field type stored in ACF

[Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Pro has a **Smart Slider 3** field type](https://smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1798-acf-publishing) that adds a custom field to a location in the WordPress back end that lets users select a Smart Slider 3 project from a dropdown list. This would, for example, allow authors to choose a different slider for every post. 

You can add this custom field to your Themer layout the same as you do with other ACF field connections. In the list of field connections, select the appropriate ACF location (for example, ACF Archive or ACF Post), then in the Options window click Autodetect and select the field where the Smart Slider information is stored. 

In the following screenshot, a custom field was created in ACF called **Smart Slider 3** with **Smart Slider 3** selected as the field type. The **Field type** and **Field name** settings are autopopulated. 

![Adding a field connection to an ACF Smart Slider field type](/img/themer-1-4-features-3.png)

## Conditional logic enhancements

The **Browser** conditional logic category has been added to the  **Rules** section of the Beaver Themer editing panel. It was already available in the **Display** setting on the **Advanced** tab in Beaver Builder modules. The selections are documented in the [Conditional Logic article](/beaver-themer/conditional-logic/beaver-themer-conditional-logic.md/#browser). It has the selections **Cookie**, **Referer**, and **URL variable**.
