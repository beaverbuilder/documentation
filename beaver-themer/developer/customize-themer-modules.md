There are some Beaver Builder modules that are specific to Themer layouts, such as the Post Navigation module for Singular layouts. You can modify or add features to these Themer-specific modules by overriding them with modules that you design.

The procedures for doing this are exactly the same as for creating custom modules that override standard modules. See the [Custom Module Developer Guide](/beaver-builder/developer/custom-modules/index.md) and specifically [the chapter about overriding built-in modules](/beaver-builder/developer/custom-modules/18-override-modules.md).
