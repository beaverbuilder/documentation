The Post Content module is in the **Post modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type Themer layout. It creates a placeholder for the content area in the layout, and it displays the content that authors create for an individual post.

:::note **Notes**
* For whatever post or page is being viewed, the Post Content module pulls the content from either the WordPress editor (standard or classic) or a Beaver Builder layout. Here's [how to use Themer Singular layouts with Beaver Builder content](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/singular-layout-type/themer-singular-layout-type.md/#extra-step-for-singular-layouts-with-beaver-builder-layouts-in-the-content-area).
* WordPress has only one content area. Although you can add more than one Post Content module to a Singular themer layout, the content in whatever page or post is viewed appears in every place you add the module, so you'll have duplicated content.
:::

The only settings available for the Post Content module are those on [the Advanced tab](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) to customize settings such as margins, responsive layout, visibility, animation, and HTML values.
