The Attached Images module is in the **Post modules** category, which appears when you're editing a Singular-type themer layout in Themer.

The Attached Images module displays all of the images from your media library that are attached to a single Post.

## Under the hood

The Attached Images module is a "shortcut" module. It's actually a Gallery module with a field connection set to **Post attached images** in the **Photos** field. When you open this module for editing, you can change the settings for layout, image size, and spacing, just like a regular Gallery module.

:::info
The field connection requires that the **Source** field be set to Media Library because that's where WordPress attachments come from.
