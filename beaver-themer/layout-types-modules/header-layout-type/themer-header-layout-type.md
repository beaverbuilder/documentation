The Themer Header layout in Beaver Themer overrides the theme's top bar, header, and nav area, as shown in the following diagram, with a typical page on the left and a typical post on the right.

## Choose a Themer Header layout template

After you create a new Header-type Themer layout and launch Beaver Builder, the initial layout contains the **Header 1**  layout template, shown in the following screenshot. 

![Screenshot of the default Themer Header 1 layout template](/img/themer--layout-types-modules--header-layout-type--1.png)

One advantage of starting with a Themer layout template is that some of the common [field connections](/beaver-themer/field-connections/field-connection-basics-themer.md) are built in. For example, shown in the next screenshot, the Heading module's **Heading** setting, where you'd normally enter the text for the heading, contains the **Site title** field connection. On the front end, this field connection is replaced with the setting in the **Site title** field on the **General** tab in your WordPress settings. This means that if you ever change your site title, you only need to change it in one place. 

![Themer Header layout template's Heading module field connection to Site Title](/img/themer--layout-types-modules--header-layout-type--2.png)

You can replace any field connection with static text if you prefer. 

There are several Themer Header layout templates to choose from. Open the Content panel and click the **Templates** tab:

![Screenshot of all Themer Header layout templates](/img/themer--layout-types-modules--header-layout-type--3.png)

You can start with any template and modify or delete whatever you like.

### Header 1 template  

![Screenshot of Themer Header 1 layout template with modules identified](/img/themer--layout-types-modules--header-layout-type--5.png)

The structure of the Header 1 template is shown in the following screenshot of the Outline panel:

![Outline panel for Themer Header 1 layout template](/img/themer--layout-types-modules--header-layout-type--4.png)

**Layout**

  * Two rows, one for the top bar and one for the header area. 
  * Two columns in each row, with one module in each column.

:::tip  **Tip**
The eye icon next to the row in the Outline panel indicates there's a special setting in the **Visibility** section of the **Advanced** tab. In this case, **Breakpoint** is set to **Large & medium devices only**, meaning this row is not visible on small devices.
:::

**Modules**

The first row has the following modules.

* An HTML module containing placeholder text for the phone number and email address.  
See the [Header 2 layout template](#header-2-template) for a different way to present the phone number.
* An Icon Group module containing social icons.

The second row has the following modules:  

* A Heading module  
The **Heading** field contains a **Site Title** field connection.   
Also, there are custom font settings in the **Typography** section on the **Style** tab. If you want to use the default heading style settings from your theme, delete these custom settings.
* A Menu module  
There are some custom margins set on the **Advanced** tab and custom padding set in various sections on the **Style** tab.   
On the **Style** tab, there are custom colors set in the following sections:
  * **Links**
  * **Dropdowns**

### Header 2 template

**Layout**

  * Two rows, one for the top bar and one for the header area. 
  * Two columns in each row, with one module in each column.

**Modules**

The first row has a custom background color and contains the following modules.

* An Icon module containing a mobile icon and a phone number.  
**Tip:** The link in the placeholder phone number is `#`.  A clickable telephone link would take the following form:

* A Photo module pointing to the site logo image in the Media Library.   
**Tip:** The Link type is set to `URL` in this template and the link is set to `#`.  Normally the corporate logo in the header links to the home page, so you'd create a field connection to the **Site URL**.

## Edit Themer Layout settings

The **Edit Themer layout** screen has the following settings for Header layouts:

![Themer Header layout overlay example](/img/themer--layout-types-modules--header-layout-type--14.png) 

* Header properties (sticky, shrink, overlay, described below).
* The [locations](/beaver-themer/locations/themer-locations-reference.md) on your site where the header applies.
* Optional [conditional logic](/beaver-themer/conditional-logic/beaver-themer-conditional-logic.md) rules.

:::info
    If you set the WordPress edit page's [Page Template](/bb-theme/getting-started/built-in-theme-templates-for-single-pages-and-posts.md) to a template that has no header for a particular post or page, it will not remove the header produced by a Themer layout. You must control where the Themer header occurs through the **Location** settings here.
:::

### Sticky, Shrink, and Overlay settings

There are several settings that control how the header behaves.

![Header Themer layout, Sticky Breakpoint setting](/img/themer--layout-types-modules--header-layout-type--15.png)

* **Sticky**
This is equivalent to the fixed header in the Beaver Builder Theme. The header stays in place at the original size while the page is scrolled.  
If you set **Sticky** to **Yes**, you then choose device size breakpoints in the **Sticky breakpoint** setting.  The **Default** setting supports large devices only (the legacy setting). It also supports the `fl_theme_builder_sticky_header_breakpoint` filter, which enables the sticky header for medium but not small devices. 
* **Shrink** (applies to large devices only)
If you choose a sticky header, you also get the option to shrink it as the page scrolls up. The amount of shrink is determined by the height required for the full-size header logo, text, and menu.   
If the **Shrink** setting is set to **Yes** it also follows the **Sticky header** setting for device size. 
* **Overlay**  (applies at all screen sizes)
The row background for the header becomes transparent, and the content row moves up to the top of the window.  
Here's an example of a header overlay:  
![Themer Header layout overlay example](/img/themer-header-layout-type-98c672a3.jpg)  
In this screenshot, the background image is set on the first row in the content area (along with a dark gray background overlay color set to 50% opacity). That row's bottom padding is set to 160px to push down the page title so it doesn't interfere with the header.  
The **Overlay** setting is independent of the "Sticky header" setting and works at all device sizes.

You can enable all three sticky, shrink, and overlay settings, and here's how they work in combination.

* If you enable **Overlay** plus **Sticky**, on large devices the transparent header converts to a sticky header as soon as you start to scroll. The sticky header background is whatever you set for the header row background.  
![Overlay plus sticky Themer header](/img/themer-header-layout-type-b17904f2.jpg)
* If you enable **Overlay** plus **Sticky** plus **Shrink**, the header shrinks as you continue to scroll down, just the way it does when there's no overlay.
