There are two ways to add a PDF file to your layout, depending on whether you
want to merely provide a download link or to view the contents of a PDF file
on-screen.

## Download a PDF file through a link

Sometimes viewers don't need to see the PDF file contents before they
download, you'd rather just provide a download button or link. Use the
following procedure.

1. On the WordPress Admin Dashboard, click **Media**.

2. Upload the PDF file by dragging it into the Media window or click **Add new** and select the file for upload.

3. Click the file you added to open the **Attachment details** sidebar and copy the URL and close the **Media Library**.

4. [Launch Beaver Builder](getting-started/launch-builder.md) on your page or post and open the module into which you want to insert the link.  
  We recommend using the Button module

5. Enter the URL to the PDF in the appropriate field and save changes.

## Display a PDF for viewing

If you want to display the contents of a PDF in a viewport on your web page, you'll have to use a plugin. Use one that lets you insert a shortcode into your layout. Make sure you're happy with the plugin's responsive capabilities so the PDFs can be viewed on small devices. If you also want your users to be able to download the PDF they're viewing, make sure the plugin offers that as well.
