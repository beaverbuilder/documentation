## All Pages list

Mouse over a page in the **WordPress Admin Dashboard > Pages > All Pages** list, then click the **Beaver Builder** link. When a Beaver Builder layout already exists for a page, the Beaver Builder link is followed by a green button, as you can see in the screenshot.

When a Beaver Builder layout hasn't been created yet, it's followed by a pale
gray or white button.

If you're viewing a page and you're logged in, the WordPress admin bar appears
on a large screen, and you can click the **Beaver Builder** link to edit the
page.

After the page is open for editing in Beaver Builder, you can watch a
video with tips on how to create a layout. Click the down arrow in the title
bar in the upper left corner of the editing page to expose the [Tools menu](user-interface/tools-menu.md).
Choose [Help](user-interface/tools-menu.md#help) and then start the video that's displayed.
