On 25 May 2018, the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/) (GDPR) will be enforced across Europe, including the UK. The law aims to give European
Union "data subjects" (natural persons) more control over their data and to
create a uniformity of rules to enforce across the continent. It applies, in
general, to anyone who sells goods or services to data subjects or processes
or holds personal information about data subjects in the EU.

##  Are Beaver Builder products GDPR-compliant?

Our Beaver Builder products are compliant with your use of them as a web
designer because we do not collect any personal information about you through
your use of our products.

As for your clients' use of websites rendered with Beaver Builder, our modules
and theme do not collect any personal information from users. However, the
GDPR lays out other requirements that, interpreted in the extreme, could even
apply to the use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which could prohibit
embedding videos and even inserting links to photos hosted on CDNs and other
websites.

We cannot give you instructions on how to make your sites GDPR-compliant, or
whether you need to make your sites GDPR-compliant at all. It is up to you to
interpret the regulation and decide what you need to do. If you need help
understanding GDPR or assistance on being GDPR compliant, we recommend you
consult with a lawyer. Some resources explaining the GDPR further are listed
in the last section.

Once you decide what you need to do to meet GDPR requirements, the Beaver
Builder team will do their best to give you information to help you modify
standard Beaver Builder functionality to achieve your goals, both through our
[Support services](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder-support/)
and in [our Knowledge Base](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com).
