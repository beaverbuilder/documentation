Problems with Beaver Builderâ€™s drag-and-drop functionality are likely due to one
of the following:

  * An error in custom code, usually JavaScript (remove the code to see if the issue resolves)
  * A [plugin conflict](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/plugin-conflicts.md)
  * A [theme conflict](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/theme-conflict.md)

If your issue is still unresolved, then it is likely related to your server
environment or configuration. Contact your web host provider or server
administrator for further assistance.
