If you don't see **Beaver Builder** in the
WordPress admin panel, it means that that it is disabled. Follow the
instructions below to enable it.

The **Beaver Builder** menu in the WordPress admin panel lets you create,
edit, and delete custom layout templates and saved rows, columns, and modules
just as you would any standard post or page. You can also add categories to
organize your templates, rows, and modules.
