If you have three or more columns and set a custom width in the **Column
Settings** editing screen, the other widths will readjust automatically. If
you try to set a custom width on one of the other columns, the custom width
you just set readjusts, and you can go around like that for a long time.

:::tip **Solution:**
There are drag handles on the edges of the columns that you can
use to resize widths. Use those resize each column width to exactly what you
want.
