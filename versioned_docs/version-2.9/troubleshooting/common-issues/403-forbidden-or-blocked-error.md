Beaver Builder uses Ajax to process your work in the Beaver Builder editor,
and if the Ajax process encounters something in your content that triggers a
403 error, you'll see a popup error message. The 403 error or sometimes a 409
error may also appear in your browser console when you have trouble saving
modules or publishing a page.

Nearly always, the 403 error (and sometimes a 409 error) is caused by your
server having mod_security enabled. Usually (though not always), the 403 error
occurs when you add some custom code to one of your modules, such as an
`<iframe>` or `<script>` tag, but it has even been triggered by using the word
*select* in a text editor.

## Technical details

`Mod_security` is an Apache module that serves as a web application firewall.
When you save or publish a page, a POST object is sent to the admin Ajax, and
it is scanned by modsec if mod_security is enabled. Tags like `<iframe>` and
`<script>` (non-UTF-8 characters) or words like *select* , which Is a keyword
used in MySQL queries, can be interpreted as a security threat and produce a
403 or 409 error in Ajax, causing the Save or Publish to hang.

## Solution

Often your web hosting provider or server administrator can resolve this issue, or you can try this solution by enabling the **Mod Security fix** found in the **WordPress Admin Dashboard > Settings > Beaver Builder > Advanced**.

This causes the request to be base64-encoded so modsec sees the offending tags and text as binary data and allows it to pass through.

:::info
You can also add the following line to the *wp-config.php* file in your WordPress home directory:

```php
define( 'FL_BUILDER_MODSEC_FIX', true );
```

This line can go in a child theme _functions.php_ in some cases, but we recommend that you put it in _wp-config.php_.

:::caution
If you've tried enabling the **Mod Security fix** and adding it to _wp-config.php_ and _functions.php_ in your child theme and it doesn't resolve the issue, contact your hosting provider or Beaver Builder Support.
