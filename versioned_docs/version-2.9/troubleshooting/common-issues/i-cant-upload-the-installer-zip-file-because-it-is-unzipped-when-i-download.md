If you're a Mac/Safari user, by default your zip files are unzipped when you
download them. This will cause a problem for installing the Beaver Builder
plugin and theme because you need to upload the zip file to your WordPress
site.

This is easy to fix by disabling a preference in Safari, either temporarily or
permanently, following the instructions below. Alternatively, you can download
the Beaver Builder plugin and theme files with a different browser, such as
Firefox or Chrome.

**To download the Beaver Builder plugin and theme zip file on Mac/Safari:**

  1. In the Safari menu, go to **Safari > Preferences**. At the bottom of the **General** tab, clear the checkbox **Open "safe" files for downloading**.  
  2. Go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and download the plugin again, and optionally the theme and child theme if you are licensed to use it.  
The files will now download as zip files, which you can use to upload to your
WordPress site.

If you want to return your Safari settings to extracting zip files and opening
other files automatically after download, repeat Step 1 and select the
checkbox.
