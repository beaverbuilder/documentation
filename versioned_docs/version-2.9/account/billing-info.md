If you elected to store your credit card information during a Beaver Builder
purchase that information is available in the **Payment methods** section on
your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page.

You can manage stored credit card information in the following ways:

* You can delete a stored credit card entry.
* You can add more than one credit card and choose whether to apply the new card to existing subscriptions.
* You can change which card is the default for new purchases.

:::caution
You cannot edit information for existing entries, so if you need to update information for a particular card, follow the procedures below to delete the old entry and add a new one.
:::

## Delete a saved credit card entry

In the **Payment methods** section, click the **Delete** button next to the credit card entry you want to delete.

## Add a new credit card

:::tip
Be sure to check the box in Step 3 if you want your new card to apply to existing subscriptions.
:::

1. Do one of the following:
  1. In the **Payment methods** section, click **Add payment method**.
  2. Mouse over **Account** in the menu at the top of the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and choose **Add/change payment method**.
2. Add the card number, the expiration date, and the CVC security number on the back of the card.
3. **Important:** If you want to use this card to renew subscriptions (automatic or manual), select the checkbox **Update the Payment Method used for all of my active subscriptions (optional)**.

The card that does not have a **Make default** button is the current default.
