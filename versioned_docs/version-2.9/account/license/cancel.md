You can cancel your Beaver Builder license at any time. Cancelling your license will prevent it from renewing automatically at the end of the billing period.

## Cancel License

To cancel your Beaver Builder license, follow these steps:

1. Log into your Beaver Builder [My Account page](../index.md).
2. Scroll to the **Subscriptions** tab.
3. Click the **Cancel** button next to the subscription you want to cancel.

:::info

If you don't see the **Cancel** button, it means your subscription is not set to [renew automatically](renew.md). You'll need to renew it manually each year.

## What Happens After Cancelling

Once you cancel your subscription, you will still have access to Beaver Builder until the end of the billing period. After that, your license will expire, and you will no longer have access to updates, support, or the ability to download Beaver Builder products.

See the [License Expiry](expiry.md) article for more information.

## PayPal Billing Agreement

One of the payment options available is PayPal. When you pay for your Beaver Builder license using PayPal, you’re entering a billing agreement with us. A PayPal Billing Agreement functions much like keeping a credit card on file for automated payments. This is facilitated by our payment administrator PayPal and allows us to collect the payment for your purchase and/or renewal.

### Cancelling Agreement

You can cancel your PayPal Billing Agreement at any time. Cancelling your PayPal Billing Agreement will cancel your Beaver Builder subscription at the end of the billing period.

If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, you can [cancel auto-renew](renew.md#cancel-automatic-renewal) within your Beaver Builder account area. You’ll then need to renew manually each year.

:::warning

Once the subscription cancels, it cannot be reactivated. A new subscription will need to be purchased to continue using Beaver Builder.

## Reactivating License

If you decide to reactivate your license after cancelling, you can do so by purchasing a new subscription. You can purchase a new subscription from the Beaver Builder website.
