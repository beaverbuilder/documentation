## Functionality After Expiry

Beaver Builder will continue to function as expected even after your license expires. However, we can only guarantee compatibility with the latest version of Beaver Builder and its add-ons. If you are using an outdated version, you may eventually encounter compatibility issues, particularly when updating other components of your website, such as WordPress, PHP, or third-party plugins and themes.

If you decide not to renew your license, we recommend exploring alternative solutions and planning a migration to another page builder plugin.
