Prebuilt rows are smaller than saved layout templates but serve the same
function--quick layouts that you can customize. You can choose from dozens of
prebuilt rows to add to your layout and modify as you like.

Images that appear are not stored in your media library, so you'll want to
replace those. Text is the default for your site, and the new **Typography**
section will let you customize the text settings on the **Style** tab.

To access prebuilt rows, on the **Rows** tab of the Content panel, select the
group **Prebuilt rows**, then click a category to see the row thumbnails.
Drag one into your layout and modify as you like.
