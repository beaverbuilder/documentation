You can move both main columns and child columns and preserve the column style settings. When you move a child column, you have a choice to move just that column or the entire parent column to which it belongs.

**To move a column and its contents:**

  1. Mouse over the module options in the column you want to move and click the **Edit column** icon to display the column choices.

column**.
