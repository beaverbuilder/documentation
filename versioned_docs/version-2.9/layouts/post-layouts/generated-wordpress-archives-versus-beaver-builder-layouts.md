Instead of or in addition to [generated index or archive
pages](/beaver-builder/layouts/post-layouts/basics-how-wordpress-handles-blog-posts-and-archives.md), you can display posts on static Pages with the Beaver Builder Posts modules. The Posts modules give you a wide range of
choices about which posts to display, how to order the display (for example,
by date, author, or category), and what to include in each listing (for
example, with or without the content excerpt). You can also display the list
as a grid, a slider, or a carousel, with several variations. For details, see
[the article on the Posts modules.](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts-posts-carousel-and-posts-slider-modules-examples.md)

The following screenshot shows a list of Beaver Builder and non-Beaver Builder
posts in a Posts module with a Columns layout.

You could use this page as a more attractive substitute for a generated
WordPress index page, or you might want to add a Posts module to a page
containing other content. For example, on your home page you might want to
display a row with a few of the most recent posts in the category of News.

:::tip **Tips**
* You can use a Page with a Posts module to simulate a generated WordPress index or archive page, but you can't put a Posts module on an actual index or archive page, because the pages are dynamically generated.

* See [this post](https://beyondbeaver.com/set-up-a-blog-with-beaver-builder-the-right-way/) for an argument why it's better in some cases not to eliminate generated WordPress index or archive pages as your blog's main index or archive.

* Don't forget that you can also save a Posts module and use its shortcode in widgets or in non-Beaver builder areas of your site. Here's an example where the shortcode for a Posts module was inserted into the footer widget layout.
