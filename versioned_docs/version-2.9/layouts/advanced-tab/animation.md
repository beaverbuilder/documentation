The **Animation** section in the Advanced tab lets you apply an entrance animation effect to any row, column or module when it becomes visible for the first time on a page.

:::info
Animations in Beaver Builder cannot be looped and are triggered once upon page load. If you want to create animations on a loop, you'll need to use the `@keyframes` rule and write your own CSS animations.

The [W3Schools @keyframes](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.php) article provides more information.
