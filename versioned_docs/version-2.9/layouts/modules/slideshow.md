## Uses of this module

Use a slideshow module when you want to display a set of images in the foreground, one at a time. Besides the traditional horizontal slide transition, there are a number of other types of transitions from one image to the next, as described in the Playback tab section below. The images come from a gallery you create either in the WordPress Media Library or in SmugMug. You can display the image title, but if there is other content you want to display and the image is of secondary importance, see the related modules described below.

## Display options

Besides various types of transitions of the slides themselves, there are various options to display navigation and play controls, an image caption, social media links, thumbnails of the gallery, and a fullscreen toggle, all described in the following sections.

Here's a screenshot of an image slideshow, showing the three main areas:

* The slides are taken from a gallery of images that you specify.
* Large navigation arrows can be displayed on either side of the slides, or with wider slides the icons are overlaid on the slides.
* The control bar appears above or below the images, depending on your settings.  
All of the icons that appear in the control bar can be displayed or hidden, as explained in more detail below.

## Slideshow module settings

### General tab

This tab has the following settings.

* **Source**  
WordPress Media Library or SmugMug.

* **Photos** (Media Library only)  
Contains links to create a gallery of images in your Media Library or to edit an existing gallery.

* **Feed URL** (SmugMug galleries only)  
Enter the URL for the RSS feed here. For help with linking to a SmugMug gallery, see the [Gallery module overview](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/gallery/gallery.md#use-a-smugmug-gallery).

#### Display section

* **Height**  
Sets the height of the box in which images and controls are displayed. The default height is 500px.

* **Skin color**  
There's not much difference, but choose **Light** if you have light-colored images and background and **Dark** if you have dark-colored images and backgroiund. Individual image size is adjusted to maintain this height.

* **Crop**  
Since the Height setting keeps the height of each image constant, the Crop setting determines whether the width of the image will adjust to display the full image (so width will vary depending on each image) or the image width expands to the full width of the column (minus margin and padding) and crops the left and right edges if necessary.

* **Disable right-click**  
Does not allow image to be downloaded.

#### Click Action section

* **Type**  
None, or choose **Link**  to add a URL that will serve as a single destination for the entire set of images. You can't set a separate link for each image.

* **Link URL**  
If you selected **Link** for the **Click action**, enter the destination URL here.

### Playback tab

* **Auto Play**  
**Yes** (the default) means the images transition automatically and can be overridden by any navigation controls that are displayed. **No** means the user must advance the images using the navigation controls.

* **Speed**  
Number of seconds the full image is displayed. The default is 3 seconds.

* **Transition**  
Choose among the following types of transitions from one image to the next.
The default transition is **Fade**.

  * **None**  
  The next image is immediately displayed instead of a transition effect.

  * **Fade**  
  Slide loses opacity while the next slide comes into view.

  * **Ken Burns**  
  The Ken Burns movement is applied during both the display and transition times with a quick fade transition to the next slide.

  * **Slide horizontal**  
  Typical horizontal movement from right to left

  * **Slide vertical**  
  Current slide moves upwards followed by next slide. There is no white space between the current and next slide.

  * **Blinds**  
  Vertical bands of white space appear over the image and become narrower until the full image is displayed.

  * **Bars**  
  The next image appears with an overlay of nearly transparent gray squares during a fade transition..The effect works best at short transition times. For longer transitions the effect more resembles the Fade transition.

  * **Random bars**  
  Vertical light gray bars of random width and spacing overlay the next image and fade out.

  * **Boxes**  
  The next image appears with an overlay of nearly transparent gray squares during a fade transition.

  * **Random boxes**  
  Random gray rectangles overlay the next image and fade out.

  * **Boxes grow**  
  The next image appears with a gray grid overlay that shrinks and disappears.

* **Transition speed**  
Number of seconds spent transitioning to the next image. The default
transition speed is one second.

* **Randomize photos**  
**No** (default) means photos are displayed in the same order as they appear in the gallery. **Yes** means the images are randomized. The randomization order stays the same with autoplay loops and navigation.

### Controls tab

This tab lets you select which controls you want to display.

The following figure shows the control icons in the control bar that you can see in the Beaver Builder editor, with the icon labels underneath the figure. Any of the icons can be displayed or hidden.

*Figure 2: Control bar icons displayed in the Beaver Builder editor*

![Control bar icons displayed in the Beaver Builder editor, see legend below figure](/img/layouts--modules--slideshow--2.png)

2 Thumbs button  
3 Caption button  
4 Fullscreen button  
5 Social button  
6 Play button

There are six sections on this tab: an unnamed top section, **Control bar**, **Control bar buttons**, **Control bar overlay**, **Thumbs**, and **Social**.

#### Unnamed top section

* **Navigation arrows**  
Choose whether or not to display larger arrows that appear on each side of the slides, shown in Figure 1. If the image is wide enough, they are overlaid on the image.  
The actual color of the arrows depends on whether you set **Light** or **Dark** as the **Skin color** on the **General** tab. These arrows may appear inside or outside of the image, depending on image width and the **Crop** setting on the **General** tab.

:::info
The navigation arrows in the control bar are controlled in the **Control bar** section.

#### Control Bar section
This section lets you choose the type of control bar and where to display it.

* **Nav type**  
    * If you don't want to display any control bar, choose **None**.

    * The **Buttons** choice displays the control bar in the layout shown in Figure 3, depending on the control buttons selected for display.

#### Control Bar Overlay section

This section has an **Overlay enabled** field, which by default is set to
**No**, meaning the control bar is displayed below or above the slides. If

**No**, the control bar overlay is always visible. If set to **Yes**, the
control bar overlay disappears after the number of seconds that you specify.

* **Pinterest button**

### Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.

##  Related modules

Other modules that display a set of images one at a time with automatic
transitions or navigation controls or both:

  * Content slider module  
Displays individual images in a set in the background, with the option of a
foreground content overlay on the image. Images displayed in the background to
fill the space often get cropped and the focus of the image usually changes as
screen sizes decreases, so this module is best used when the focus is on the
content overlay and the background image is used for effect.

  * Posts Carousel and Posts Slider modules  
These module display a set of posts or pages one at a time with the option to
display a featured or fallback image. Use these modules when you want to
display information about a set of pages or posts.
