description: The Testimonials module is a basic slider that offers an animiated way to display testimonials or any other combination of heading, text, and media.
---

Use the Testimonials module to add a basic slider with testimonials to your
layouts, or any other set of text and images that you want to display one by
one with either autoplay or navigation.

If the Testimonials module is the only module in a row, select **Wide** so it
takes up the entire row. If you are using the Testimonials module with other
modules in the same row, set the layout to  **Compact**.

You can add as many testimonials as you like and customize a variety of
options, such as autoplay, animation effects, and navigation choices. Each
individual testimonial has a Text Editor box, so you can add anything that a
WordPress editing box accepts, such as headings, text, and images.

Note that although it's called a Testimonials module, there's nothing to stop
you from using it for other purposes, because it's basically a slider for any
headings, text or media.  For example, you could use this module on an About
Us page, where you want to introduce each of your team members. And not just
people â€“ you could set up something like a portfolio of your creations, in
which each image has a description that's too long for a caption. Or, you
could have a selection of your favorite quotations, displayed one by one.

This module has the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
