As an alternative to embedding a video directly in your page, you can have a
visitor click to play a video in a lightbox.

You can use either a [Button module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/button/button.md) or a [Video module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/video/video.md) to play a video in a lightbox.

## Button module lightbox features

* The user clicks from a button to open the video in the lightbox.
* You must use embed code or a URL to a location that can play the video, such as Youtube or Vimeo. It will not work with a video uploaded to your media library.
* This feature works from the **Button** module, not from buttons in other modules such as a Callout.

## Video module features

* The user clicks a preview or poster image of the video on the page to open the video in the lightbox.
* The video can be in the Media LIbrary or played from a location such as Youtube or Vimeo, using embed code or a URL.
* The Video module has a **Structured data** tab where you can enter metadata about the video that assists search engines.
