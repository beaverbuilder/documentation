Module Blocks are Beaver Builder modules that are developed as WordPress blocks for use in the WordPress block editor. These blocks maintain all the features and settings found in their module counterparts.

## Using Module Blocks

1. In the WordPress block editor, click the + plus icon.
2. Click the **Browser All** button.
3. In the block library sidebar, scroll down to the Beaver Builder section where you can find all module blocks.

You can also use the `/beaver` command to quickly access a list of all Beaver Builder module blocks. Simply type `/beaver` in the WordPress block editor and a modal window will appear with a list of all available module blocks. You can then select the module block you want to use.

## Configure Module Blocks

Each module block has the same features and settings as its module counterpart. When you add a module block to the block editor, you can configure the module block in the block settings sidebar _(right-hand side of the block editor)_.
