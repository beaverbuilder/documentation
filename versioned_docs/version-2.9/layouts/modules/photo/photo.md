The Photo module lets you insert an individual photo from your WordPress Media
Library or a custom URL.

Here are some of the options with the Photo module:

* You can select the photo from your Media Library or use a URL. If the file is from the Media Library, you can select the size of the photo to display.

* You can crop the photo into several geometric shapes: Landscape, Panorama (longer and shorter than landscape), Portrait, Square, Circle.

  :::info
  Cropping will cut off parts of your photo, depending on the shape of
  the original photo and the shape of the crop.
  :::

* You can specify the alignment of the photo within the column: left, center, or right. If you display a caption, both the photo and the caption will be aligned according to this selection.

* You can display the caption of the image and specify how and where the caption appears in relation to the photo: on hover (appearing at the inside bottom of the photo) or below the photo. If you're getting the photo from an external URL, there's a field for you to enter a caption.

  :::note **Note:**
  Longer captions are truncated at the end of the first line. See [this article](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/photo/display-full-captions-under-photos.md) for how to display the full caption.
  :::

* You can add a link to the photo, with several choices of where the link goes:
  * A URL, for example, to another web page.
  * A lightbox  
  A popup where the photo appears in a dark background over the page. If you've
  set the **Show caption** field to **On hover** or **Below photo**, the
  caption will appear below the photo in the lightbox in both cases.

  * Photo file  
  The photo file is displayed by itself.

  * Photo page (for Media Library photos only)  
  The photo is displayed with the header, footer, and sidebar of the website.

* There are the standard Advanced tab features: margins, animation, and showing/hiding on particular device sizes.

:::tip **Tip**
It's a best practice to keep photos to the exact size that you need.
Although the photos are automatically sized to fit your display, a larger
photo increases page open time.

## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
