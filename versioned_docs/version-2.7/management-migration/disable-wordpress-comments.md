In current versions of WordPress, comments are disabled by default on pages,
but they are enabled on posts. Here's some information about how to disable
comments.

## Disable comments for individual posts

You can disable comments on individual posts on either the Quick Edit or Edit
screen. Disabling comments will also hide the comment icon in the post meta on
archive pages.

**To disable comments by Quick Edit:**

  1. Display the list of posts and click **Quick Edit** for the post on which you want to disable comments.
  2. Clear the **Allow comments** checkbox.

**To disable comments on the Edit page:**

  1. Display the list of posts and click **Edit** for the post on which you want to disable comments. Don't start up the Beaver Builder editor.
  2. Below the text editor, in the **Discussion** section, clear the **Allow comments** checkbox  
If you can't see a **Discussion** section, [see this article](/beaver-builder/management-migration/change-wordpress-screen-options.md).

## Disable comments by post type

To disable comments based on the post type (posts, custom, etc), we recommend
the following plugin: [No Page Comment](https://wordpress.org/plugins/no-page-comment/).

## Disable comments site-wide

  1. On the WordPress admin panel, choose **Settings > Discussion**.
  2. Clear the checkbox **Allow people to post comments on new articles**.
