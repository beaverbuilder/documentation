This article applies to how to convert content from the Standard (block) or Classic
editor in WordPress 5 to Beaver Builder and vice versa. It also describes the
result of each type of conversion. [Follow this link](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/launch-builder.md) for how to install the Classic Editor plugin and how to
open the Beaver Builder editor in WordPress 5.

:::warning **Warning:**
You can start editing a new page in either WordPress editor
(Standard or Classic) and convert to Beaver Builder and vice versa, but beware
of switching back and forth after that--you may lose data.

If you open a Beaver Builder layout in the Standard or Classic editor and
make further edits, and then you convert back to Beaver Builder, you'll see
your previous Beaver Builder layout. You won't see the new WordPress edits
that you made. If you publish the Beaver Builder layout and open the page
again in Standard or Classic Editor, you'll lose the previous edits that you
made in the Standard or Classic Editor.

Unless you enable Posts in **Settings > Beaver Builder > Post
types**, you will only see the option to launch Beaver Builder for Pages, not
Posts.

## Convert content from the Standard (block) Editor to Beaver Builder

This section applies when a page has content created with the WordPress
Standard (block) Editor and you want to convert that content to Beaver
Builder. You can use [any of the methods for opening a page in Beaver
Builder](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/launch-builder.md), or you can convert directly from within the Standard Editor, as follows. No matter what method you use to open Beaver Builder,
the content is automatically converted. Pay attention to the warning above.

**Convert content to Beaver Builder from within the WordPress Standard Editor:**

  1. Click the **More** icon (three vertical dots) in the upper right corner of the standard edit screen.
  2. In the **Plugins** section, choose **Convert to Beaver Builder**, as shown in the following screenshot.

Editor module.

content in Classic Editor that you want to convert to Beaver Builder.

that you want to convert to the Standard (block) Editor.

  1. From the WordPress admin panel, choose **Pages > All Pages**.
  2. Mouse over the page that you want to convert to reveal the choices.  
The dot following the Beaver Builder link will be green, showing that the
layout is currently in Beaver Builder.
