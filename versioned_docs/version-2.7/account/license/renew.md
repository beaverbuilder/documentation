In this article, we explain how your Beaver Builder license renewal works and why it is a good idea to renew it every year.

## Automatic Renewal

If you purchased Beaver Builder **after May 1st, 2017**, your license will renew automatically unless you [switched to manual renewal](#cancel-automatic-renewal).

:::info
If you purchased Beaver Builder **before May 1st, 2017**, you will need to manually renew your license from your account page. You’ll be able to renew one month before your subscription expires.
:::

## Cancel Automatic Renewal

If you are set up for autorenewal, you can cancel it, and when your subscription expires you can either manually renew or let your subscription lapse.

1. Go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and scroll to the **My Subscriptions** section.

2. Click the **Cancel Renewal** button next to the subscription you'd like to cancel.

:::info
If you don't see the **Cancel Renewal** button, it means you're not in the autorenewal program and you'll have to renew it manually each year.
:::

:::caution
We cannot reinstate auto-renewal if you cancel it later, but you can still renew manually. 
:::

If you do not renew your Beaver Builder license, please refer to the [What happens if I don't renew?](#what-happens-if-i-dont-renew) section for more information.

## Renewal Discount

You're entitled to a 40% discount if you purchased Beaver Builder **before October 13, 2022**. Your subscription discount pricing will remain unchanged as long as you renew within 2 weeks of the expiration date.

You’ll receive an email the day your subscription expires with access to a renewal link. We will also send out a reminder email one week from the day your subscription expires.

If for some reason you don’t receive these emails, [contact us](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/contact/) and we’ll get you fixed right up!

## What happens if I don't renew?

In the event that your Beaver Builder license expires, you will no longer be able to download products from your account page. However, any copy that you have already downloaded can still be installed and used. Essentially, you are limited to using the Beaver Builder version that was released at the time your license expired. Additionally, Beaver Builder Support will not be available to you.

:::caution
Please note that we cannot guarantee that older versions of Beaver Builder will continue to work if you update other components on your site, such as WordPress, PHP, or third-party plugins.

For these reasons, if you decide not to renew your license, we advise you to start thinking about moving your content to another solution.
