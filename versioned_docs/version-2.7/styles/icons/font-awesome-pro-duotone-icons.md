If you've enabled Font Awesome Pro and the Duotone Icon set, you can customize
the two colors of Duotone icons.

:::info
The secondary icon's color will automatically have reduced opacity.
Also, Duotone icons don't have different hover colors.
:::

Where the duotone color settings appear and how the icons appear when these
colors aren't set depends on the module.

Module  |  Button behavior  
---|---  
Accordion  |  Set Duotone icon colors in the **Icon** section on the **Style** tab. If the Duotone icon color isn't set, and for other icons, color comes from the **Text color** setting in the **Label** section on the **Style** tab. If **Text color** isn't set, then the color of the label and the icon comes from the accent color set by your theme.  
Button  |  Set Duotone icon colors in the **Icon** section of the **Style** tab. If the Duotone icon color isn't set, and for other icons, color comes from the **Text color** setting in the **Text** section on the **Style** tab.  
Call to Action  |  Set Duotone icon colors in the **Button icon** section on the **Button** tab. The settings appear when you choose a Duotone icon. Other icons are controlled by the **Button text color** setting in the **Button text** section.  
Callout  |  Set Duotone icon colors in the **Icon colors** section on the **Image** tab. You must select a Duotone icon for these settings to appear. Duotone icons are grayscale until the primary and secondary Duotone colors are set. Other icons are controlled by the **Heading color** setting in the **Heading** section on the **Style** tab.
