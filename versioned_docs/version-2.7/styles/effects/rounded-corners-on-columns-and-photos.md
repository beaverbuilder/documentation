You can add rounded corners to a column background or border or a photo using the **Radius** setting in the Borders section of rows, columns, and some modules that let you set borders, such as the Photo module. The **Radius** setting is described in the [Radius & Shadow](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/radius-shadow.md) article.

You can add other effects to photos, such as cropping them into a
circle, in the Photo or Callout module. Click the **Crop** list on the
**General** tab of the Photo module or the **Image** tab of the Callout module
and choose a cropping option.
