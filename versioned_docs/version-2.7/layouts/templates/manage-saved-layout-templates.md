You can manage saved layout templates in the following ways:

  * You can [edit, delete, or rename the title or slug](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/rename-title-or-slug-saved-template-row-column-module.md) of your saved layout templates.
  * You can [organize the display of your saved templates into categories](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/categorize-and-add-thumbnails-to-saved-templates-list.md) in Beaver Builder, as shown in the following screenshot.  
![](/img/layout-templates-manage-templates-1.png)
  * You can [add thumbnails to the list of saved templates](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/categorize-and-add-thumbnails-to-saved-templates-list.md), as shown in the following screenshot:  
![](/img/layout-templates-manage-templates-2.png)
  * You can [export custom templates](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/export-import-content.md) to use on other sites, or you can import templates from your own sites or other sources.
  * If you have the Agency version of Beaver Builder, you can [replace the set of built-in templates with your own set](/beaver-builder/white-labeling/replace-built-in-layout-templates-with-your-own.md), making it easier to provide your clients with a custom solution. Your templates are displayed in a grid style the same way that the built-in layout templates are normally displayed.
