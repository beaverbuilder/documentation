You can change the title or the slug name for a saved template, row, column,
or module.

  1. In the WordPress admin panel, click **Beaver Builder** , then choose **Templates** , **Saved rows** , **Saved columns** , or **Saved modules** , depending on what you want to rename.  
If you can't see the **Beaver Builder** menu in the WordPress admin panel, see [this article](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/cant-find-the-beaver-builder-menu-in-the-admin-panel.md) on enabling it.
  2. Mouse over the item you want to rename and click **Edit** when the menu appears.
  3. Change the title and optionally the slug and click **Update**.  
If you don't see the **Slug** field, click **Screen options** in the upper
right corner of the screen and make sure the **Slug** checkbox is selected.

Once the change is made, it will apply to all instances of the saved template,
row, or module.
