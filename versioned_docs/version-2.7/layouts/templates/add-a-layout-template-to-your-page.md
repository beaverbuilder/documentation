Layout templates are Beaver Builder layouts that are prebuilt, previously saved, or provided by third parties. See the [layout templates overview](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/layout-templates-overview.md). They do not enforce a particular layout or style but rather provide a way 

**To replace existing content or append a layout template to your Beaver Builder content:**

  1. Open a page for editing in Beaver Builder.
  2. Open the [Content panel](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/user-interface.md/#8-14-content-panel) and click the **Templates** tab.
  3. Click on the layout template you want.  
If the page or post layout already has content, you'll get a choice of replacing the existing layout or appending the new layout.
4. Make any changes you want and save your page.
