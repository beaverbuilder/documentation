You can display an image with a saved row, column, or module on the **Saved**
tab in the Content panel.

The image comes from the featured image set for the saved item. It fits the
width of the pane on the **Saved** tab, with a width-to-height ratio of 2:1.
The item's title is displayed below the image. In the following screenshot,
the saved module called "Purple button" is displayed with its featured image,
which was created by taking a screenshot of the module.
