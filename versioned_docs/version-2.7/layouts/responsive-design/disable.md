title: Disable Responsive Behavior
sidebar_label: Disable Responsive Behavior
description: The Spacing section in the Advanced tab lets you change the default margin and padding for rows and columns. For modules, you can change the default margin values only.
---

You may [disable responsive behavior](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/global-settings.md#enabledisable) site-wide from the [Global Settings](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/global-settings.md). If you disable responsive behavior, the layouts you see on extra large devices will be preserved on large, medium, and small devices.

When you disable responsiveness site-wide, you lose the following functionality: 

* Column stacking doesn't occur.

* Margins and padding stay the same on every device, ignoring any previous settings for large, medium, and small devices on individual rows, columns, and modules, and not allowing new ones.

* Other responsive settings in [Global settings](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/global-settings.md#responsive-layout) and on the [Advanced tab](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) of individual rows, columns, and modules are ignored, except for the choice to [hide rows, columns, or modules on specific device sizes](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/visibility.md).

:::warning Warning
We strongly discourage you from disabling Beaver Builder's responsive behavior.
