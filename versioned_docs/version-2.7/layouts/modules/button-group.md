---

The Button Group module is a way to display multiple buttons in a single column, either horizontally or vertically.

![Button group module example](/img/button-group-30a865c5.png)

It's based on the [Button module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/button/button.md), so the settings are very similar.

In the Button Group module, there's a **Style** tab that applies to all of the buttons, and then there's a **Style** tab for each button you create. Any setting on an individual button's **Style** tab overrides the global setting for the button group.

:::tip **Tip**
If you're using the Beaver Builder Theme, the buttons' initial style comes from the settings at **Customize > General > Buttons**. The button's default text color
is white text for darker accent colors and black text for lighter colors. The
default font family for the button text depends on the font family set for the
`<body>` tag.
:::

We'll break down the settings by [global button tabs](#global-button-tabs) and [single button tabs](#single-button-tabs).

## Global button tabs

### Buttons Tab (global)

**Button group label**  
An optional label for accessibility that adds an `aria` attribute with the value you specify here. For example, if you add the label <kbd>button group</kbd> for this setting, the rendered HTML shows the attribute `aria="button group"`.

**Button 1**  
Click **Edit button** to configure the first button.

**Add button**  
Click to create each additional button.

### Style Tab (global)

This tab has four sections: a top section, **Text**, **Background**, and **Border**.

#### 1 Top section (global)

Here's a diagram that illustrates the global padding, spacing, and width settings in this section. Each setting is described below.

![Button group padding, spacing, and width](/img/button-group-2.png)

* **Layout**  
Choose a horizontal or vertical placement of the buttons.

:::tip **Tip**
A horizontal layout wraps the buttons to another line as screen size decreases. A vertical layout wraps the button text to another line as screen size decreases. Enter <kbd>R</kbd> on the keyboard to enter [Responsive Mode](/beaver-builder/layouts/responsive-design/editor.md) to compare layouts at smaller screen sizes.
:::

* **Width**  
This setting controls the width of the buttons in the group. The values are **Default** and **Custom** but the behavior varies according to the type of layout.   
When **Width** is **Default** and **Layout** is **Horizontal**, the width of each button varies according to the individual button text plus **Button padding**. This means that buttons with more text are wider:  
![Button group - Default width setting for horizontal layouts](/img/button-group-3.png)  
Buttons wrap to a second horizontal line if necessary but the text doesn't wrap.  
When  **Width** is **Default** and **Layout** is **Vertical**, the button spans the entire width of the container minus the **Container padding** amount. Button text wraps if necessary.  
When **Width** is set to **Custom** in either horizontal or vertical layouts, the width of every button is set to the custom width you specify. Text wraps if necessary:

* **Align** (responsive)  
This setting horizontally aligns the entire button container within its row or column. See [this article](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/alignment.md) for a description of how the alignment toggle settings work.
* **Container padding** (responsive)  
Adjusts the padding between the edge of the button group container and the group of buttons.
* **Button padding** (responsive)  
Adjusts the padding between the edge of each button and the button's content. You can override this setting with the **Padding** setting on each button's **Style** tab.
* **Button spacing** (responsive)  
Increase or decrease the amount of horizontal or vertical space around the outside of each button. You can set the spacing as `px`, `em`, `%`, or `vw`. See [the article about dimensional units](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/css-length-height-units.md).
