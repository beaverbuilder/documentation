The Button module is an exactly that: an object that you insert into your layout that resembles a physical button.

## Uses of this module

  * Traditionally, a web button is a pretty package for a link that sends visitors elsewhere when clicked.

  * The button can also [open a lightbox](#set-the-click-action-to-a-lightbox), which displays a video or any other content that you can insert with a shortcode, HTML, or code such as an `<iframe>`.

:::tip **Tip**
You can play a video in a lightbox using either a Button module or a Video module. For a description of the differences, see the article about [opening a video in a lightbox](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/video/open-a-video-in-a-lightbox.md).

## Button examples

### Button style

#### Default button style

If you're using the Beaver Builder Theme, the buttons' initial style comes from the settings at **Customize > General > Buttons**. The button's default text color
is white text for darker accent colors and black text for lighter colors. The
default font family for the button text depends on the font family set for the
`<body>` tag.

### Click Action: Link or Lightbox

You can set the button's click action to either a link or a lightbox.

#### Set the click action to a link

When you set **Click action** to **Link**, a Link section opens.

  * Enter the URL to the link or click **Select** to choose a page or post from your site.
  * Set **Link target** to determine whether the linked page replaces your current page in the same tab ( **Same window** ) or opens in a new tab ( **New window** ).
  * The **Link No Follow** field tells search engines whether or not to follow the link. The default is **No**, which tells search engines to follow the link. **Yes** means "Yes don't follow the link." For more information about when to use `nofollow`, see the [Google webmaster article](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569?hl=en).

#### Set the click action to a lightbox

If you choose the **Lightbox** option, you next choose whether the lightbox will display custom HTML content or play a video from a URL you provide, as described in the following sections.

**HTML content**

With the **HTML** option, an HTML editing box lets you enter custom code such as HTML markup, embed code for a video, or shortcode. In the following screenshot, the shortcode for a saved row containing a **Call to Action** module was inserted into the HTML box to make an opt-in popup.

Other shortcode examples:
* Embed an audio player with [audio shortcode](https://wordpress.org/support/article/audio-shortcode/).
* Use shortcode from a plugin to display the contents of a PDF file.
