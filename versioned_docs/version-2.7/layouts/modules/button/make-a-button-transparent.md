A transparent button means the button's background color is semitransparent or
completely transparent. Especially in the case of a completely transparent
background color, there's a border around the button. The hover state can also
be solid, transparent, or semi-transparent.

Make the button's background color transparent by changing the opacity of
the button's **Background color** setting, using the color picker slider. See
the [this article about the color picker](/beaver-builder/styles/colors/color-picker.md). Then you can create a button
border in [the **Border** section](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/borders.md).
section.

Where the background color and border settings are located depends on the
module in which the button occurs:

  * In the Button module, the **Background color** setting and **Border** section are on the **Style** tab.
  * In the Callout module, these settings appear on the **Link** tab when you set **Type** to **Button** in the **Call to Action** section.
  * In the Call to Action module, Contact Form module, and Subscribe Form module, the settings appear on the **Button** tab.
