description:  Here's some code that limits which post types are searched in all of the Search modules on your site.
---

By default, the Search module searches pages, posts, and any custom post types that exist. You can limit the search to specific post types with some custom code. For example, you could search the WooCommerce **product** post type only.

The code varies according to whether or not AJAX is enabled on your site.

## AJAX enabled

Set a filter that uses `fl_builder_loop_query_args` to specify which post types are allowed in search.

In the following code example, `post` and `product` are specified in the array as the post types to search. Add your code to *functions.php* in your child theme.

```php
add_filter( 'fl_builder_loop_query_args', function( $args ){
	if ( isset( $args['s'] ) ) {
		$args['post_type'] = array( 'post', 'product' );
	}
	return $args;
});
```

The code affects all Search modules on your site.

## AJAX disabled

If AJAX is disabled, use `pre_get_posts` instead. See [this WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/pre_get_posts/).
