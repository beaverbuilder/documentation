In the row settings, there are two choices for row height:

* Default  
The row height adjusts to fit the content.

* Full height  
The row height fills the height of the browser window.

* Minimum height  
The row height is at least as tall as the value entered using `px`, `vh` and `vw`. See [this article comparing these CSS height and width units](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/css-length-height-units.md) in more detail.
