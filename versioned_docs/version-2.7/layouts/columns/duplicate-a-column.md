When you duplicate a column, an identical column with all the column settings
and any modules it contains is duplicated to the right of the current column,
as in the following example.

![](/img/row-columns-duplicate-cols-1.png)

You can then move it to the position you want and edit the column settings and
its contents.

**To duplicate a column:**

  * Mouse over the column you want to duplicate and click **Duplicate column** in the submenu.
