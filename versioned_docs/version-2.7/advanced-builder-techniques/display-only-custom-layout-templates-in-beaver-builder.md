OK, you've created some custom layout templates, perhaps assigned them
categories and an order, and now they appear in a separate tab or group under
the built-in layout templates.

Now suppose you want to hide the built-in Beaver Builder layout templates and
display only your own.

Using the procedure below, the **Saved templates** group displays by default,
with your custom layout templates displayed according to any categories you've
assigned, as shown in the screenshot below.

**To display only custom layout templates:**

  1. In the WordPress admin panel, click **Settings > Beaver Builder** and then click the **Templates** tab.
  2. In the **Enable templates** section, select **Enable user templates only**.
  3. Click **Save template settings**.

:::tip **Tip**
If you have the Agency version of Beaver Builder, you'll see an
**Override core templates** checkbox on this screen. This is related to white
labeling the custom templates to remove the **Edit** and **Delete** links from
the display.
