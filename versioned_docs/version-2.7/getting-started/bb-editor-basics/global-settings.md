Global Settings lets you to configure default values for options such as row max-width, margin/padding, breakpoints, and custom code (CSS & JavaScript) which are then applied globally on your site. You can override the majority of these settings on a per row, column and module basis via their settings.

## Access Global Settings

Global Settings can be accessed via the **Tools menu**, or using the keyboard shortcut:

* <kbd>command âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> (<i className="fab fa-apple"></i> Mac)
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> (<i className="fab fa-windows"></i> Windows).

## Default Page Heading

The **Default Page Heading** option lets you show or hide the default theme heading for the **Page** post type.

* **Show** gives you two choices, these are **Yes** or **No**.  
  When **Yes** is chosen, the theme's page title will display on your Beaver Builder layouts. When choosing **No**, you must enter the CSS selector for your active theme's page heading for this feature to work.

* **CSS Selector** allows you to enter the theme's CSS selector for the page title. The default selector `.fl-post-header` is used to hide the page title for the BB Theme.

To learn how to hide the page title for third-party themes, visit the [Show or hide the page title](show-or-hide-the-wordpress-page-title.md) article.

## Rows

### Margin & Padding

Configure the default margin and padding value for all directions (top, right, bottom, and left) for rows globally. Use the responsive settings to enter values on a per device basis (large, medium, and small).

* **Margin** accepts `px`, or `%` [CSS units](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css_units.asp).  
  The default value is `0px`.

* **Padding**  access `px`, `em`, or `%` CSS units.  
  The default value is `20px`.

### Max Width

Lets you set the default max-width for all rows using `px`, `vw` or `%` CSS units.

The default value is `1100px`.

### Default Row Width

Choose between **Fixed** or **Full-width** which will be the default for all rows. You can override this on a per row basis via the row settings.

## Columns

### Margin & Padding

Configure the default margin and padding value for all directions (top, right, bottom, and left) for columns globally. Use the responsive settings to enter values on a per device basis (large, medium, and small).

* **Margin** accepts `px`, or `%` CSS units.  
  The default value is `0px`.

## Responsive Layout

### Enable/Disable

Enable or Disable the Responsive Layout settings, these include:

* [Auto Spacing](#auto-spacing)
* [Large Device Breakpoint](#large-device-breakpoint)
* [Medium Device Breakpoint](#medium-device-breakpoint)
* [Small Device Breakpoint](#small-device-breakpoint)
* [Enable Col Max-width](#enable-column-max-width)
* [Reverse Column Order](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/stacking.md)

When **Disabled** only [Bast Font Size](#base-font-size) is available.

### Auto Spacing

Auto Spacing removes the requirement to manually configure margin and padding settings for each row and column on small devices, ensuring consistent spacing throughout the layout. This simplifies the design process and can result in considerable time and effort savings.

* When **enabled** (default), Auto Spacing configures the margin to `0px` for all directions and the padding-left and padding-right to `0px` for both rows and columns on small devices. The padding-top and padding-bottom inherit the values configured in the Global Settings or those defined for the small device size in the row or column settings.

  The CSS code snippet below displays how the CSS is represented for both rows and columns on small devices.
 
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .fl-row[data-node] .fl-row-content-wrap {
      margin: 0;
      padding-left: 0;
      padding-right: 0;
    }
    .fl-col[data-node] .fl-col-content {
      margin: 0;
      padding-left: 0;
      padding-right: 0;
    }
  }
  ```
  
* If you **disable** Auto Spacing, the margin and padding values set for desktop will be inherited by the small device size instead.

:::info
If you need more precise control over the spacing of rows and columns on small devices, you can modify the margin and padding options for each row and column individually. These options can be found in the Advanced Tab for the specific row and column that you are currently working on.

### Large Device Breakpoint

The **Large Device Breakpoint** setting lets you configure the `max-width` at which the layout will adjust for large devices. The default value is `1200px`.

### Medium Device Breakpoint

The **Medium Device Breakpoint** setting lets you configure the `max-width` at which the layout will adjust for medium devices. The default value is `992px`.

### Small Device Breakpoint

The **Small Device Breakpoint** setting lets you configure the `max-width` at which the layout will adjust for small devices. The default value is `768px`.

:::tip
Tablets in portrait orientation are considered small devices, while tablets in landscape orientation are considered medium devices.
:::

### Use Responsive Settings in Previews?

When **Enabled (Yes)** the Beaver Builder Preview and Responsive Editing will use the **Large Device Breakpoint**, **Medium Device Breakpoint**, and **Small Device Breakpoint**.

When **Disabled (No)** the Beaver Builder Preview and Responsive Editing will use the hard-coded values which are `1200px` for **Large**, `769px` for **Medium**, and `360px` for **Small** devices.

### Enable Column Max Width

When **Enabled**, columns assigned 50% width or less are limited to `max-width: 400px` when screen width reaches or goes below the [Small Device Breakpoint](#small-device-breakpoint).

### Base Font Size

If **Font Size** in the [Typography](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md) settings is set to the `vh` or `vw` CSS unit the **Base Font Size** will be used to calculate the font size.

## CSS & JavaScript

The CSS and JavaScript tabs allow you to apply custom CSS and JavaScript globally throughout the site. If custom CSS or JavaScript have been added, a green dot appears next to the Global Settings menu item.
