## Cancel Automatic Renewal

If you cancel autorenewal, you will need to manually renew your subscription each year. You can cancel autorenewal at any time from your account page and follow these steps:

1. Go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and scroll to the **My Subscriptions** section.
2. Click the **Cancel Renewal** button next to the subscription you'd like to cancel.  
  If you don't see the **Cancel Renewal** button, it means you're not in the autorenewal program and you'll have to renew it manually each year.

:::caution

We cannot reinstate auto-renewal once you cancel it, but you can still renew your subscription manually.
