You will notice that in all of the examples we are using WordPress' built-in
translation functions such as `__()` and `_e()`. The default text domain that
we have provided, `fl-builder`, should be changed out to your plugin folder's
name should you decide to translate your plugin. See the [WordPress codex](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/) for more info on translating your plugin.
