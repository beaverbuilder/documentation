Beaver Builder integrates with Yoast, allowing you to utilize Yoast for the analysis and optimization of your Beaver Builder content for SEO.

## Getting Started

To get started using the [Yoast SEO plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) with Beaver Builder, install and activate the plugin on your website.

## Analyze Content with Yoast

To analyze your Beaver Builder content with Yoast, follow these steps:

1. Build your page or post layout as usual and publish your changes.
2. Access your **WordPress Admin Dashboard**.
3. Go to the **WordPress Edit Screen** for the page or post you want to analyze.
4. Scroll down to the **Yoast SEO** section view the recommendations for your content.
5. Launch Beaver Builder on your page or post again to make changes to your content based on the Yoast recommendations.

Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the SEO analysis of your content.

:::tip

An efficient workflow includes opening two browser tabs: one for your WordPress Edit Screen to review the Yoast analysis of your content, and the other for Beaver Builder with your page or post loaded. This setup allows you to edit your content in the Beaver Builder browser tab and then switch to the other browser tab containing the WordPress Edit Screen.

Remember to refresh each time you make a change in Beaver Builder.
