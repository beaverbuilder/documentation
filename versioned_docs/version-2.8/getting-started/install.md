## Download

Download the Beaver Builder plugin zip from the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page. Your license key also appears on that page.

:::tip
If you're a macOS/Safari user, by default your zip files are unzipped when you download them. This will cause a problem for installing the Beaver Builder plugin because you need to upload the zip file to your WordPress site.

This is easy to fix by disabling a preference in Safari, either temporarily or permanently, following the instructions below. Alternatively, you can download the Beaver Builder plugin and theme files with a different browser, such as Firefox or Chrome.

1. In the Safari menu, go to **Safari > Preferences**. At the bottom of the **General** tab, clear the checkbox **Open "safe" files for downloading**.

2. Go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and download the plugin again, and optionally the theme and child theme if you are licensed to use it.

3. The files will now download as zip files, which you can use to upload to your WordPress site.

## Install

1. From your WordPress Admin Dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New**.

2. Click the **Upload plugin** button at the top of the screen.

3. Click **Browse** and select the downloaded zip file on your local system.

4. After you have selected the file, click on the **Install Now** button.  

  :::info
  If you have the [Lite version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) of the plugin installed, it is automatically deactivated when you install a premium version. You can delete the Lite plugin without losing your layouts.

  :::tip
  With the introduction of [WordPress 5.5](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/29/miscellaneous-developer-focused-changes-in-wordpress-5-5/), it is no longer necessary to uninstall your existing Beaver Builder plugins when upgrading or downgrading to a new version.

  By following the steps mentioned earlier to install the zip file, WordPress will present a prompt that allows you to choose whether you want to replace the currently installed version with the one you are uploading. Simply click on the "Replace current with uploaded" button, and WordPress will handle the rest of the process.

5. If you're doing a fresh installation of any premium version, click **Activate** to activate the plugin.
 
## Activate your license

1. From your WordPress Admin Panel, go to **Settings > Beaver Builder**.

2. Click the **License tab**.

3. For new installations, add your license key, which you can find on the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page.  
  For upgrades and downgrades, check to make sure your license is still active. The license number should remain the same.
