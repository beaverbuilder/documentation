## What Our Support Covers

We support any product sold on this site ( www.wpbeaverbuilder.com) and only our respective products. We are happy to help with general questions, installation, configuration and general usage of our products. It is always recommended you first check our knowledge base before submitting a ticket. Older versions are supported until your subscription expires, but in most cases, you’ll be asked to update to the latest stable version for assistance.

Our support covers bug fixes and once brought to our attention we will attempt to fix as quickly as possible and/or provide an interim solution until a maintenance, minor, or, major release depending on our product release schedule. If you do in fact believe you have found a bug, please ensure you follow our troubleshooting guide before submitting a ticket as we will most likely ask you to perform these steps before proceeding.

## What Our Support Doesn’t Cover
We do not provide support for third-party products, services, add-ons, extensions, code or other products/services/code not otherwise provided by us. This does not include specific integrations or code we provide as part of our products. While we are happy to answer questions related to/or about WordPress itself and our products to the best of our ability, we do not provide general WordPress support, installation, and or customization.

Our products are provided on an “as is” basis as stipulated in our Terms and Conditions and as such we do not provide customization support/services for our products. Customization can be categorized as changes that otherwise affect the appearance and/or functionality of how our products are offered. If you are in need of customization support/services, please refer to our Recommended Builders page.

## How We Offer Support
We offer support exclusively through our website ( www.wpbeaverbuilder.com), specifically, our support ticketing system. We do not provide phone support or support via social channels. Our support ticketing system is extremely secure and any information you submit pertaining to your support request will only be accessible to you and our support team.

In addition, Beaver Builder has a very robust and helpful ecosystem. We encourage you to join the Facebook, Slack, or Forum communities. You may find these a helpful source of information and assistance in addition to our internal support.

## Support Availability
We offer support Monday to Friday, 7:00 am – 7:00 pm PST. Most support requests are responded to within a few hours, but we do our best to answer all questions by the next business day. We are unavailable on weekends and US Holidays.
