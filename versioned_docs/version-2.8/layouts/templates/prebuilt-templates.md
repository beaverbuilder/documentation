Beaver Builder comes with a number of prebuilt templates that you can use to design your pages faster.

## Usage

You can use a prebuilt template that looks similar to the design you want, tweak any settings, rearrange elements, and add your own content to create a stunning page in no time. You can also play around with different layout templates to get ideas or learn how they were made.

:::warning Warning
The images used in prebuilt templates are not stored locally in your site's WordPress media library, so you'll need to replace them with your own.
