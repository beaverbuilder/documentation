## Responsive Behavior

Layouts created with Beaver Builder are fully responsive out of the box, which means they automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes, ensuring that your layouts will look great on any device. It is also possible to fine-tune your responsive layouts even further with [Beaver Builder's responsive features](#responsive-features).

You can see how your layouts adapt to different screen sizes in the screenshots below.

## Responsive Features

Beaver Builder provides the following features to fine-tune your responsive layouts further.

* You can preview and edit your layouts in a way that ensures they look great on all devices using the [Responsive Editor mode](editor.md). In addition, you can set custom width and height values to preview your website in a variety of widths and heights.

* With [Custom Breakpoints](breakpoints.md#custom-breakpoints), you can set your own preferred widths for different device sizes overriding [Beaver Builder's default breakpoint](breakpoints.md) values.

* Using [Visibility](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/visibility.md) options, you can hide specific nodes (rows, columns, and modules) on your website for selected devices, allowing you to customize your user experience accordingly.

* By using the [Responsive Toggle](toggle.md), you can define different row, column, and module settings per device, such as margins, padding, and even background images.

* [Columns stack](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/stacking.md) automatically for small devices due to the limited viewing area, and one column is usually the best design. You can avoid and control column stacking by setting custom column widths for each device size, or by reversed column stacking order.
