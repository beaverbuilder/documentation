MailChimp changed their default subscriber setting to single opt-in â€“ in other words, a subscriber submits a subscription form connected to the MailChimp API and is automatically subscribed. Double opt-in is when the subscriber submits the form and receives an email asking for subscription verification.

If you're using the Beaver Builder Subscribe Form module, you can enable double opt-in with a Beaver Builder filter. See the [filter examples article for the MailChimp opt-in filter code](/beaver-builder/developer/tutorials-guides/common-beaver-builder-plugin-filter-examples.md/#enable-double-opt-in-for-mailchimp-integrations).
