description: Here's some CSS code to use if you want space between the post images in a Posts module Gallery layout.
---

When you choose the **Gallery** layout style in the Posts module, by default there is no space between the featured images for each Post in the gallery, such as in the following screenshot.

![](/img/how-to-tips-space-in-post-gallery-1.png)

You can use the following CSS rule to increase spacing between the featured images in the display:

```css
.fl-post-gallery-post {
  margin: 20px;
}
```

Increasing to a `20px` margin separates the space between images as shown in the following screenshot. You can see that the increased margins can also lead to different break points in the rows.
