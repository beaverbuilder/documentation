The Separator module inserts a horizontal line to separate content.

## **General** tab

- **Color**
  By default, the line is a light gray color.
- **Height** (responsive)
  This is the thickness of the line style. For double lines, as the **Height** value increases, the thickness of both lines and the space between them increases. This setting can be set differently for each device size. By default, the height is 1px.
- **Width** (responsive)
  The width of the line relative to row width. You can choose a **%**, **px**, or **vw** unit of measurement. By default, the line is 100% wide.
- **Alignment** (left, center, right) (responsive)
- **Style**
  The choices are **Solid**, **Dashed**, **Dotted**, **Double**.

:::info
The **Double** line style must have a height of at least 3px set to display as a double line.
