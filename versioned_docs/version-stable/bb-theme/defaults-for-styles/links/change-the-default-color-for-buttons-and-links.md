description: Describes how to set a custom default color for buttons and links in the Beaver Builder Theme, which applies to Beaver Builder layouts.
---

When you create items such as links or buttons, a default color is assigned to them. The base default color comes from the [Beaver Builder Theme preset](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/presets.md), which can be set at **Customize > Presets**.

You can override the preset default and [set a custom default accent color](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md/#accent-color) at **Customize > General > Accent Color**.

You can also [create a number of custom default settings just for buttons](/bb-theme/defaults-for-styles/links/set-global-default-button-styles.md), which overrides the accent color settings.
