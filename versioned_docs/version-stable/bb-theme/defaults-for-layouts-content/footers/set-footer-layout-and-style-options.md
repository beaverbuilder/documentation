The footer consists of two parts: an optional footer widgets area, and an optional bottom footer bar, similar in content to the top bar in the header.

In the bottom footer bar, you can set one or two columns and choose what type of information will appear there – text, social icons, or a menu. For the entire footer area, you can also set a parallax, which controls how the footer is displayed.

The footer bar layout and style options are set in **Customize > Footer**. See the artciles on [the **Footer** tab in Customizer](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/footer.md) and [setting options for footer widgets](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/widgets/set-options-for-footer-widgets/).
