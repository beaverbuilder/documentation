:::note **Note**
By default, the Beaver Builder editor is enabled for page layouts only. You can [enable posts and custom post types in the Beaver Builder settings](/beaver-builder/management-migration/control-which-post-types-can-use-beaver-builder.md).

## 1\. From the WordPress editing page (block or classic)

### 1.1 From the WordPress Block Editor

When you create a page or open an existing page in the WordPress block editor,
you'll see the choice of **Launch Beaver Builder** or Use Standard Editor, as shown in the following screenshot.

:::note **Note**
If you're using the Classic Editor plugin and don't see the **Beaver Builder** tab, one way to make it
appear is to force the use of Classic editor rather than the WordPress block editor.
On the WordPress admin panel, go to **Settings > Writing** and select **No**
for **Allow users to switch editors**. If you want users to continue to have a
choice of WordPress editor for each page or post they create, use any of the
other methods described here to open the Beaver Builder editor.
:::

## 2 From the All Pages list

Mouse over a page in the **Pages > All Pages** list, then click the **Beaver Builder** link.

When a Beaver Builder layout already exists for a page, the Beaver
Builder link is followed by a green button, as you can see in the screenshot.
When a Beaver Builder layout hasn't been created yet, it's followed by a pale
gray or white button.

## 3 From the WordPress admin bar

If you're viewing a page and you're logged in, the WordPress admin bar appears
on a large screen, and you can click the **Beaver Builder** link to edit the
page.

video with tips on how to create a layout. Click the down arrow in the title
bar in the upper left corner of the editing page to expose the **Tools** menu.
