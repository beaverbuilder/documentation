There are three modules that insert a display of Posts or Pages into a Beaver
Builder layout: Posts, Posts Carousel, and Posts Slider. The difference in the
modules is the way the posts or pages are displayed and the settings that are
available to configure layout, content, and style. In addition, the modules
can have more than one layout. See the individual articles about the [Posts](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts.md), [Posts Carousel](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts-carousel.md),
and [Posts](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts-slider.md) Slider modules for details about
settings.

## Which of the posts modules to choose?

The main distinction between the Posts module and the other two modules is
that the Posts Carousel and Posts Slider modules can be animated, while the
Posts module cannot.

The Posts module displays a subset of posts in a variety of layouts. You can
control the number of posts displayed and also control pagination of the
display. There are a number of screenshot examples in the following section.

:::tip **Tip**
If you want to display the full text of a post, you must use a Posts
module and choose the **List** layout type.
:::

In a carousel, a few items are presented in a horizontal row, with animation
or the manual ability to progress through a larger set. In the Posts Carousel
module, the post or page title and other information are overlaid on the
featured image. The following screenshot shows one of the variations of the
Posts Carousel module, with the navigation shown as dots below the posts. See
more examples later in this article.

In a slider, an image is usually displayed in a background that fills the
screen horizontally, overlaid by text, cycling through a set of image/text
combinations. Here's an example of a Posts Slider module layout. See more
examples later in this article.

## Posts module examples

### Posts module – Columns layout

Posts or pages are displayed in top-aligned layers of columns. In this
example, the columns are not set to equal height, so each layer is top-
aligned, but the bottom borders are adjusted to fit the posts.

### Posts module – Masonry layout

Posts or pages are displayed with alternating heights, as shown in this
screenshot:

### Posts module – Gallery layout

Gallery layout displays featured images in blocks of equal height and width
with no space between. Mousing over an image shows post information, as shown
in the following screenshot. You cannot display post content with Gallery
layout.

When the post has no featured image, only the post information is displayed.

### Posts module – List layout

In **List** layout, posts or pages are displayed in a vertical list takes up
the full single-column width. The featured image can be set to appear in any
of the following locations:

  * **Above title**

  * **Above content**

  * **Left**  
The image is top-aligned with the title.

## Posts Carousel module

### Gallery layout

The Gallery layout of the Posts Carousel module displays the featured image in
a single row of blocks of uniform height and width, and when you mouse over
the image the title and post info are displayed with a color background, as
shown in the screenshot below. You can't display post content with the Gallery
layout.

### Grid layout

The Grid layout of the Posts Carousel module displays the thumbnails of
featured images with post title, optional post info, and optional post excerpt
underneath. The column height can be equalized, which means the content
borders are the same size and the columns are top-aligned.

## Posts Slider module

The Posts Slider module only has one layout style: an animated display of one
post or page at a time, with post or page text overlaid.

The featured image can be displayed in two ways.

  * The featured image can be set to display as the background with the post info and post excerpt appearing on top, as in the following screenshot:

![](/img/post-modules-examples-14.jpg)

  * The featured image can be set to a thumbnail, with the post info and excerpt appearing to the left or right of it, as in this screenshot:

![](/img/post-modules-examples-15.jpg)

When the featured image appears in the background, you can set the post text
to the left, right, or bottom of the slide. When the featured image appears as
a thumbnail you can set the post text to appear to the left or right of the
image.

You can also set a background color for the text portion of the slide. You can
choose whether the background color is the full height of the slide or covers
only the portion of the slide where the text is displayed. You can also choose
the opacity of the background color and whether the background has a gradient.

:::tip **Tip**
To stretch the slides to the full width of the browser window, in the
Row settings make the row full width, the content full width, and set the row
padding to 0px on left and right. Change the Posts Slider module margins to
0px on left and right.
:::

The following screenshots show some more examples of the text background
settings.

In the next screenshot, **Text background height** is set to **Auto**, and
text padding is set to 50 px. With text placed on the left, the text
background extends to the slide border on the top and left and extends 50px
beyond the text on the right and bottom.

 **Posts Slider with text left, featured image in background, text background
color #333333,  80% opacity, auto height, no gradient:**

![](/img/post-modules-examples-16.jpg)

Compare with the next screenshot, in which **Text background height** is set
to **100%**. In this case, the text background extends to the slide border on
the top , left, and bottom and extends 50px beyond the text on the right.

**Posts Slider with text left, featured image in background, text background
50% opacity, full height, no gradient:**

![](/img/post-modules-examples-17.jpg)

The following slide matches the settings in the previous slide, but with a
gradient. Note how the opacity is the full 50% opacity at the left edge and
decreases towards the center.

**Posts Slider with text left, featured image in background, text background
50% opacity, full height, gradient:**

![](/img/post-modules-examples-18.jpg)

With thumbnail images, the text background is always a solid color and fills
the slide background, as shown in the following screenshot. Text background
opacity and gradient do not apply to thumbnail layouts.

**Posts Slider with text right, featured image as thumbnail, text background
set to dark gray:**
