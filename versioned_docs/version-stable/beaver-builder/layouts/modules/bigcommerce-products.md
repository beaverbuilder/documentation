If you have the BigCommerce plugin for WordPress installed, the BigCommerce
Products module is available in the **BigCommerce** section in the **Standard
modules** group in the Content panel for regular Beaver Builder layouts.

This module lets you add any of the following displays of products or subsets
(as defined in your BigCommerce database):

  * The entire list of products (select **No** for the following three filters to display the entire set)
  * Featured products only
  * Sale products only
  * Recent products only

Here's a screenshot showing this module used to display sale items:

As you can see in the screenshot, there is only a **Content** tab and
**Advanced** tab, no **Style** tab. However, you can change background and
text color in the row or column settings, as you can see in this screenshot:

## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-rows-columns-modules.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
