You can save a row, column, or module for reuse on your site. You can also
[export saved rows, columns, and modules](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/export-and-import-saved-templates-rows-columns-modules.md) for use in other websites.

You can save your row, column, or module as standard or global. When you save
an item as global, each instance of it that you drag into any page on your
site is linked to all other instances. Any change you make to one instance
will update all instanced and the global saved version. If you save an item as
standard, each instance in your layout is independent of the centrally saved
row or module and from any other instance of it. In other words, once you drag
a standard row or module into your layout, it's just like any other row or
module at that point.

If you already have a row, column, or module created in a Beaver Builder
layout, follow the first procedure here. If you want to create a saved row or
module before you have created a row or module in a regular layout, you can
use the second procedure.

##  Save a row, column, or module from your layout

If you've already created the row, column, or module that you want to save for
reuse, follow these instructions.

**To save an existing row, column, or module for reuse:**

  1. Open the page that contains the row, column, or module you want to save.
  2. Open the row or module for editing by clicking the wrench tool.
  3. Click **Save as.**
  4. Enter a name for your saved module, decide if it will be standard ( **No** ) or Global ( **Yes** ) and click **Save**.

Your saved rows and columns can be accessed on both the **Rows** tab and the
**Saved** tab in the Content panel. Saved modules are accessed on the
**Saved** tab. They can also be accessed for editing through the Beaver
Builder menu on the WordPress admin panel, as described in the next section.

## Create a saved row, column, or module directly

You might want to create a saved row, column, or module that is not related to
the layout on any specific page, for example to use it on future pages that
you create or to use it in a Beaver Builder shortcode.

In this case, you can directly create and edit saved rows and modules in the
Beaver Builder admin area, which can be accessed from the WordPress admin
panel, as shown in this screenshot.

:::note **Note**
At this time, you can edit saved columns in the Beaver Builder menu
but you can't create new ones. Instead, use the procedure in the previous
section to create the column you want to save in a page or post layout and
then use **Save as**.
:::

Choose either of the following procedures to create a saved row or saved
module respectively.

**To create a saved row in the Beaver Builder admin area:**

  1. From the Beaver Builder menu in the WordPress admin panel, click **Saved rows**.
  2. At the top of the panel, next to the **Saved rows** title, click the **Add new** button.
  3. Add a title.
  4. Select the checkbox if you want to make the saved row global
  5. Click **Add saved row**.
  6. Click **Launch Beaver Builder**.  
Under your page header, you'll see either an empty row and column.

  7. Create the layout you want for the saved row or module by dragging modules into the empty column, adding more columns, or modifying the row and column settings.  
You can add multiple layers of columns, but you can only create one row.

  8. Click **Done > Publish** to save the row.  
The saved row now appears both in the Beaver Builder admin area under **Saved
rows** and also in regular page layouts in Beaver Builder on the **Saved** tab
in the Content panel.

**To create a saved module in the Beaver Builder admin area:**

  1. From the Beaver Builder menu in the WordPress admin panel, click **Saved modules**.
  2. At the top of the panel, next to the **Saved modules title**, click the **Add new** button.
  3. Add a title.
  4. In the **Module** field, select the type of module you want to create.
  5. Select the checkbox if you want to make the saved module global.
  6. Click **Add saved module**.
  7. Click **Launch Beaver Builder**.  
Under your page header, you'll see an empty module of the type that you chose.

  8. Mouse over the module to reveal the Wrench icon, then click it to open the module settings.
  9. Add the module's settings, save the module, and click **Done > Publish.  
**The saved module now appears both in the Beaver Builder admin area under
**Saved modules** and also in regular page layouts in Beaver Builder on the
**Saved** tab in the Content panel.
