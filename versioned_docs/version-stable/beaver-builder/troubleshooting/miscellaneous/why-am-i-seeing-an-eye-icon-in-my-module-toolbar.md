To be more precise, you may be seeing an Eye icon in any of the row, column,
or module toolbars.

No, we're not watching you. When you [limit user visibility](/beaver-builder/styles/visibility/change-element-visibility-by-user-login-and-capability.md) in the
**Visibility** section on the **Advanced** tab settings of a row, column, or
module, the Eye icon appears in the toolbar to remind you that the row,
column, or module might not appear in the rendered version of the page. The
Eye icon is shown in the following screenshot.
