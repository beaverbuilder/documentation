[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/349c6d6d-3c39-4dba-b3b7-2b867a74f1fa/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/angry-gates-bead98/deploys)
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-Welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/beaverbuilder/documentation/issues/new/choose)

This repository contains the source of the Beaver Builder knowledge base, which can be viewed at [https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com/](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com/). The article content for the knowledge base lives within the [docs/](https://github.com/beaverbuilder/documentation/tree/master/docs) directory.

The Beaver Builder knowledge base is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), with search powered by [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) running our own [crawler](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/run-your-own).

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to the Beaver Builder knowledge base by forking the repository and submitting pull requests.
You are also very welcome to make any suggestions or report any kind of problem with the documentation by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/beaverbuilder/documentation/issues/new/choose).

#### Caveat

Articles are written using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) plus the [Docusaurus markdown guide](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction).

**Note:** Issues in this repo are for documentation issues, and any issue not related to documentation will be closed as not relevant. Contact [Beaver Builder Support](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder-support/) for other product issues.
