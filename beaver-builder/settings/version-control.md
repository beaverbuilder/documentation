The Version Control tab allows you to quickly install any of the last 10 releases of Beaver Builder, Beaver Themer, or the Beaver Builder Theme (BB Theme) without manually downloading files or using the WordPress plugin or theme installer.

## Enable Version Control

The Version Control tab is only available when [Beaver Builder Debug Mode](/beaver-builder/settings/tools.md#debug-mode) is **enabled**, so you must enable Debug Mode before you can access and use it. To access and use Version Control, you’ll need to first turn on Debug Mode.

This requirement ensures that version switching is used intentionally, as it’s primarily a troubleshooting and development tool. Once enabled, you can easily roll back or switch between the last 10 releases of Beaver Builder products directly from your settings panel.

## Installing a Version

To install, open the dropdown menu for the product you want, select the version you’d like to install, and click Install. The process takes only a few moments. During installation, a message will appear saying _“Installing, please wait!”_. When the installation is complete, a notification in the top-right corner will confirm _“Version Installed!”_.

:::warning

We strongly recommend creating a backup before switching versions.

## Disable Version Control

To disable Version Control, simply disable Beaver Builder Debug Mode. This is useful for preventing accidental version changes.
