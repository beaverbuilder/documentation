## Available Downloads

The **Available Downloads** section lists all associated products included with your license. From here, you can also install other Beaver Builder products, such as the **BB Theme**, **BB Child Theme**, and **Beaver Themer** plugin.

The section uses several suffixes to indicate the status or actions available for each product:

- **Install** – Installs the product automatically without requiring additional steps.
- **Installed** – Indicates the product is already installed and ready to use.
- **Downgrade `<version>` to `<version>`** – Downgrades the product (e.g., _Downgrade Professional to Starter_) to the version you own.
- **Upgrade `<version>` to `<version>`** – Upgrades the product (e.g., _Upgrade Professional to Agency_) to the version you own.
- **Activate** – Click Activate next to **Beaver Themer** to enable the plugin. Clicking Activate next to the **Beaver Builder Theme** or **Beaver Builder Child Theme** redirects you to _WordPress Admin Dashboard > Appearance > Themes_, where you can activate the selected theme.
