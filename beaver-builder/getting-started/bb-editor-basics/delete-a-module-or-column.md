You can delete a module and leave the column, or you can delete a column, which also deletes the column's contents.

:::tip **Tip**
Deleting columns and child columns can get complicated. It's safer to delete modules first and then the empty columns and if you delete something you regret [use the Undo feature](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/undo-redo.md).

## Delete a module and leave the column

If you delete a module from a column that has more than one module, the other
modules will remain in the column. If you delete a module when it's the only
module in the column, an empty column will be left behind.

1. Mouse over the module to reveal the options.
2. Click  **X**  to delete the module, or click the hamburger icon and then  **Remove**.  
See the screenshot below

3. Verify that you want to remove the module.

## Delete an empty column

  1. Mouse over the column to reveal the options.
  2. Click **X** to delete the column, or click the hamburger icon and then **Remove**.

## Delete a column or child column and its content

When you delete a column or child column, the contents of the column are also
deleted.

:::tip **Tip**
It's a good idea to mouse over **Delete column** before you click
it. The scope of what will be deleted is shaded in blue. Or, to be extra safe,
delete individual modules instead of columns using the **Remove** command in
the module options, then delete any empty columns.
