If you get a 404 error when you're trying to edit a page or a saved row or
module in Beaver Builder, usually the solution is to reset your permalinks.

**To reset the permalinks for your site:**

  1. On the WordPress admin panel, go to **Settings > Permalinks**.
  2. Click  **Save changes**.  
If that doesn't solve the problem, continue with the following steps.

  3. On the **Settings > Permalinks page**, make a note of your current permalink setting.   
If it's set to **Custom structure**, copy the text in the box so you can
paste it back later.

  4. Select **Plain**, then click **Save changes**.
  5. Select the setting you had before.  
If you had **Custom structure** selected, paste the custom text into the text
box.

  6. Click **Save changes**.
