When you create a custom IcoMoon icon set, be sure to rename the CSS Selector
value from **icon-** to any other prefix before downloading. The `icon-`
prefix can interfere with other uploaded icon sets and cause the icons to
disappear, or other display issues.

See the [Settings Icon](settings/icon.md) article on enabling, disabling, and uploading icon sets.
