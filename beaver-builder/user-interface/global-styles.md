2. Assign a name to your color, such as "primary color."
3. Use the color picker to choose your desired color.

:::caution
While assigning a color name, it's advisable to use lowercase characters, for instance, "primary color," instead of using uppercase or capital letters, like "Primary Colour."

You have the option to include additional global colors by either clicking the **Add Global Colors** button or duplicating a color item using the duplicate icon located in the upper right-hand corner.

### Global Color CSS Variables

Any Global Color you create is automatically generated as a CSS Variable, which can be utilized in custom CSS. The CSS Variable uses a prefix of `--fl-global-color-`, followed by the name of your assigned global color.

For example, if you named a global color item as **primary color**, the CSS Variable for that item would be `--fl-global-color-primary-color`.

You can make use of your global color in custom CSS by using the CSS Variable, as shown in the example below:

```css
p {
  color: var(--fl-global-color-primary-color);
}

.my-custom-class {
  color: var(--fl-global-color-secondary-color);
}

#my-custom-id {
  color: var(--fl-global-color-tertiary-color);
}
```
