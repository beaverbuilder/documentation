## Libraries

Once you connect your account to Beaver Builder Cloud, you gain access to Libraries, a central hub for creating, organizing, and reusing assets across your sites. You can also access Shared Libraries, making it easy to collaborate and use resources created by others. Libraries let you save the content and settings you use most often, so you can quickly apply them to new projects without starting from scratch. You can store the following in your libraries:

- Templates
- Posts and Pages
- Beaver Themer Layouts
- Media
- Colors
- Code Snippets
- WordPress Theme Settings

## Showcase

In addition to the Libraries tab, Beaver Builder Cloud also includes the Showcase tab, which provides inspiration and makes it easy to find ready-to-use templates and assets for your next WordPress website project. Some libraries are available for free, while others require a purchase to access, such as the popular Beaver Kit.

## User Access

Beaver Builder Cloud includes user access controls that allow you to define which WordPress user roles can manage templates and assets through the Cloud interface, while restricting access for others.
