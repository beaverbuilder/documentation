The open and close icons **(+/x)** do not appear when the panel is [pinned](#pinunpin-the-user-interface-ui) to the left or right side of the screen. Instead, there's a show or hide icon at the bottom of the panel.

## Adding Content

You can use the Content panel to add content to your pages and posts, such as templates, rows, columns, and modules.

## Drag Handle

Click and hold the left mouse button on the drag handle icon to move the Content panel anywhere on the screen. You can also pin the Content panel to the left or right of the screen.

### Pin/Unpin the user interface (UI)

:::caution
You should also be aware that if you pin the Content Panel, the Settings Window will be automatically pinned.
:::

By default, Beaver Builder uses a pop-up window for presenting settings such as the Content panel, row, column, or modules. However, the user interface (UI) can also be pinned on the left or right of the screen and is useful if you're on a small screen or find the pop-up window gets in the way.

You can pin the pop-up window by dragging it to your preferred side of the screen and dropping it into blue vertical areas that appear on the left and right. To unpin the panel, grab the top of the panel and drag it back to the center.

## Group selection

Each tab (modules, rows, templates & saved) are organized into groups. Click the **Group** box to navigate to other groups for that tab.
