## Overlay Outline

The Overlay Outline appears as a solid border around rows, columns, and modules once you [launch Beaver Builder](getting-started/bb-editor-basics/launch-builder.md). The colour of the outline varies depending on your actions or the type of content in the layout. 

### Overlay Outline Colors

* A Blue outline indicates the row or module you're currently editing.

* A Gray outline appears around the row for the column or module you're currently editing.

* An Orange Outline appears around global rows, columns, or modules in your layout.

### Empty Columns

If your layout contains empty columns, the outline will appear dashed.
