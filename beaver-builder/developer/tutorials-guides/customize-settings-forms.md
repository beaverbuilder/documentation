It is possible to customize any of the settings forms in Beaver Builder,
including the ones built in.

You'll need a solid grasp of how settings forms are created to understand how to customize them, so If you haven't already, see our [custom module guide](/beaver-builder/developer/custom-modules/index.md) before continuing. That guide has everything you'll need.

To customize a settings form, use `fl_builder_register_settings_form`, as shown in the following code.

```php
function my_builder_register_settings_form( $form, $id ) {
  if ( 'row' == $id ) {
    // Modify the $form array for rows as needed.
  }
  elseif ( 'button' == $id ) {
    // Modify the $form array for button modules as needed.
  }
  return $form;
}
add_filter( 'fl_builder_register_settings_form', 'my_builder_register_settings_form', 10, 2 );
```

In the callback function for that filter, you will receive the following two variables.

## $form (array)
This is the configuration array for the form that was passed to the
register method when it was created. You can modify this as needed to
customize a settings form.

:::tip **Tip**
Removing settings can lead to errors, so it's usually best to add and
not remove core settings.
:::

## $id (string)
This is the ID for the form that was passed to the register method when it was created. For modules, this is the module's folder slug.
