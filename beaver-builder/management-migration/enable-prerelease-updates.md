Beaver Builder makes [alpha and beta prereleases](../introduction/releases-versioning.md) available to license holders for all of their products. Normally, you have to download the first alpha or beta release and install it by uploading it. Once installed, the prerelease automatically notifies you of updates to new versions of the prerelease in the WordPress admin panel's **Plugins > Installed plugins**.  

On Beaver Builder's **Settings > Tools** section on the WP admin panel, there's a **Tools** tab with a Prerelease updates section where you can enable your site to update to any beta prerelease that comes out. You can even enable updates to any new alpha prerelease, though that's not recommended for production sites.

Here's how to enable updates to prerelease versions.

:::info
Enabling prerelease updates using this setting applies to all Beaver Builder products that you have installed. If you want updates to apply to only one product, continue to follow the instructions for the manual installation method in [this article](../introduction/releases-versioning.md#install-alpha-or-beta-releases).
