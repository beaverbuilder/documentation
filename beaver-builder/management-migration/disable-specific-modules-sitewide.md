description: Shows how to disable modules from appearing in the Beaver Builder editor.

---

You can control which modules will display in the Content panel in the Beaver Builder editor. If there are some modules you never use, or some modules you don't want your clients to use, you can disable specific modules or even disable all modules.

:::tip **Tip**
You can add a filter so the **Settings > Beaver Builder > Modules** tab shows you which modules are being used in your website or website templates. This can make it easier to decide which modules to disable. See [this filter example](/beaver-builder/developer/tutorials-guides/common-beaver-builder-plugin-filter-examples.md/#show-which-modules-are-in-use-in-a-website) for more information.
:::

To disable or re-enable modules:

1. In the WordPress admin panel, click **Settings > Beaver Builder**, then click the **Modules** tab.
2. Clear the checkboxes of any modules you want to disable.
3. Click **Save module settings**.
