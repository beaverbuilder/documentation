The **Beaver Builder** admin panel means the view you see when you click **Beaver Builder** from the WordPress admin panel. In this list of your various Beaver Builder saved items (templates, rows, columns, modules), you can configure which table columns
are displayed, how many items are listed on a page, and the type of view (list vs.
excerpt).

**To configure the screen options in the Beaver Builder admin panel:**

  1. In the WordPress admin panel, click **Beaver Builder**.  
If you don't see **Beaver Builder** in the admin panel, see [the article on enabling it](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/cant-find-the-beaver-builder-menu-in-the-admin-panel.md).

  2. In the **Beaver Builder** submenu, click the type of layout you want to set screen options for: **Themer layouts** (if Beaver Themer is installed), **Templates**, **Saved rows**, **Saved columns**, **Saved modules**, or **Categories**.
  3. Click **Screen Options** in the upper right corner.
  4. Configure the display settings and click **Apply**.
