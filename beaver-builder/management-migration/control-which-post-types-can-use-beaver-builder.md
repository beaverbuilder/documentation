By default, the Beaver Builder editor is enabled only for Pages, as shown in
the following screenshot.

![](/img/admin-settings-control-post-types.png)

If you select **Posts**, you can use Beaver Builder to design the content
area of single Posts.

If you have WooCommerce installed, select **Products** to lay out single
product page content in Beaver Builder.

If you have custom post types, select them to enable the use of Beaver Builder
to lay out the content area of single custom posts.

:::note **Notes**

  * For Posts and all custom post types including WooCommerce products, selecting these choices lets you use Beaver Builder to lay out just the content area of the post types you select. If you want to use the same post content layout for multiple posts, [save the layout from one post as a layout template](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/create-and-save-a-custom-layout-template.md), then [add that template](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/add-a-layout-template-to-your-page.md) to each new post you create.
  * These post-type settings apply only to regular Beaver Builder layouts in the content area of the page, not [Beaver Themer](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/) layouts, which apply outside the content area. The two are mutually exclusive, in that if a Singular-type Themer layout applies to a post or page, you can't use Beaver Builder to lay out the content area, and vice versa. For more information, see [the primer about the content area versus other parts of the page](/beaver-themer/getting-started/primer-on-wordpress-content-and-theme-areas-themer.md).
