The **Settings > Beaver Builder** panel has a number of tabs, and we'll go
through each one.

:::info
The Ultimate and Agency versions of the Beaver Builder Plugin allows [white labeling](//beaver-builder/white-labeling/white-labeling-beaver-builder.md) to display any other name you choose, so there could be a different name under the **Settings** menu.
:::

## Welcome tab

The **Welcome** tab has the following information:

* Beginner's guide to using Beaver Builder.
* Overview of the latest update, including links to detailed change logs.
* Recommendations for other popular products from Beaver Builder.
* Resources for community engagement and support.

##  License tab

The **License** tab is where you enter your premium license key to unlock updates. This tab also lists which products are included in your license.

## Modules tab

![Modules tab page overview](/img/bb-settings-overview--modules.jpg)

By default, all of the built-in modules are enabled, but you can disable specific ones. For example, you might want to eliminate modules you know you'll never use. For more information, see [the article on disabling modules](/beaver-builder/management-migration/disable-specific-modules-sitewide.md).

## Post Types tab

By default, Beaver Builder is only enabled for Pages. You can enable it to insert layouts into the content areas of single Posts. If you have WooCommerce plugin installed, you'll see a Products post type, and if you have other custom post types, they'll appear here also.

For more information about working with Beaver Builder to design Post content
areas, see the article about [how Beaver Builder works with blogs and custom post types](/beaver-builder/layouts/post-layouts/how-beaver-builder-works-with-blogs-and-custom-post-types-start-here.md).

:::info
* The Beaver Builder plugin applies to layouts in the content area of your page or post. Standard WordPress headers, footers, and sidebars are controlled by your theme, or by using Beaver Themer, which lets you apply Beaver Builder layouts to theme-controlled areas. See the article on [what you can do with Beaver Builder](/beaver-builder/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-builder.md/#plugin-vs-theme-vs-beaver-themer) for more information about the content area.

* If you have Beaver Themer installed and create a Singular layout for Posts or Pages, you will not be able to use Beaver Builder to edit the content area of the page. See the [Beaver Themer primer on WordPress content and theme areas](/beaver-themer/getting-started/primer-on-wordpress-content-and-theme-areas-themer.md).

## Templates tab

The **Templates** tab refers to the landing page, content, and custom layout templates that you can add to a page when you're designing your layout in Beaver Builder. See the [overview of layout templates](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/layout-templates-overview.md).

These layout templates can be accessed from the **Templates** tab in the Content panel, or with the keyboard shortcut `l` _(lowercase L)_.

The **Templates** tab in **Settings > Beaver Builder** lets you choose whether to display or hide the standard layout templates called **core templates** ), your custom layout templates (called **user templates** ), both or neither.

If you have the Agency version, you can replace built-in templates with your own set, making it easier to provide your clients with your own custom solution.

See this article about [replacing built-in layout templates with your own](/beaver-builder/white-labeling/replace-built-in-layout-templates-with-your-own.md).

##  User access tab

You can enable or restrict access to various areas of the Beaver Builder user interface for each of the four WordPress user roles independently: Administrator, Editor, Author, or Contributor. For more information, see the article on [granting user access](/beaver-builder/management-migration/control-user-access-by-role.md).

## Icons tab

The library of icons available to you in modules is determined by what is enabled in this setting. Beaver Builder comes with the Font Awesome, Foundation, and WordPress Dashicons icon sets.

You can also add your own icon sets through this UI, by helping you upload custom sets from Fontello or IcoMoon to your Media Library. For help and tips creating custom icon sets, see the article about [icon sets](/beaver-builder/styles/icons/enable-disable-or-delete-icon-sets.md).

## Branding tab (Agency version only)

Agency versions only have a **Branding** tab, where you can change the name of the Beaver Builder plugin as it appears in the user interface, as well as the Beaver Builder theme if you're using it. See White Label (Agency) sectrion in this knowledge base for other ways to white label your websites.

## Help Button tab (Agency version only)

Agency versions only have a **Help button** tab, where you can customize what your clients see when they click **Help**. See the article on [customizing the Help button](/beaver-builder/white-labeling/customize-the-help-button.md).

## Tools tab

The **Tools** tab has the following sections.

* [**Cache**](../troubleshooting/debugging/issue-fixer-clear-the-cache.md)
* [**Cache Clearing Tool**](../troubleshooting/debugging/cache-clearing-tool.md)
* [**Debug Mode**](../troubleshooting/debugging/enable-beaver-builder-debug-mode.md)
* [**Prerelease Updates**](enable-prerelease-updates.md)
* [**Uninstall** section](../troubleshooting/updates-license/uninstall-or-deactivate-the-beaver-builder-plugin.md)

## Advanced tab

The Advanced tab within Beaver Builder's settings provides options to enable or disable settings that typically require custom coding to achieve specific outcomes.

See the [Advanced Settings](advanced-settings.md) for more information.

## Import / Export tab

The Import / Export tab allows you to export, import, and reset Beaver Builder [global settings](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/global-settings.md).

See the [Import & Export Settings](import-export-settings.md) article for more information.
