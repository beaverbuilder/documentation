Each license type has its own set of features and limitations, such as the level of support and the number of sites where Beaver Builder products can be installed and used.

## Current License Types

We offer the following licenses for sale through our website:

- Starter License
- Professional License
- Unlimited License

For more information and a detailed comparison of each license type, see our [Pricing](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/pricing) page.

## Legacy License Types

Legacy licenses refer to any Beaver Builder license purchased before September 10th, 2024. This date marks when Beaver Builder introduced its current licensing structure, which includes the Starter, Professional, and Unlimited license tiers.

The following license types are considered legacy licenses:

- Standard License
- Pro License
- Developer License
- Agency License
- Ultimate License

For those customers who had previously purchased these licenses, we do allow upgrades to current licenses, as well as permitting them to continue maintaining an active legacy license by keeping up to date with all renewal payments.
