You can continue to use your legacy license as long as you maintain an active subscription.

### Switching License Plans

If your legacy license was purchased or renewed more than 30 days ago, you’ll have the option to switch to one of our new plans at your next renewal.

:::caution

Before switching to one of our new license plans, please consider the following:

- Renewal discounts associated with your legacy license will not carry over to the new plan.
- Some new license plans include site usage limits.
- Switching from your legacy license is permanent and cannot be reversed.
  
We recommend reviewing the new license options and their features on our pricing page before making your decision.
