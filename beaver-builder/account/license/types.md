You can continue to use your legacy license as long as you maintain an active subscription.

### Switching License Plans

If your legacy license was purchased or renewed more than 30 days ago, youâ€™ll have the option to switch to one of our new plans at your next renewal.

:::caution

Before switching to one of our new license plans, please consider the following:

- Renewal discounts associated with your legacy license will not carry over to the new plan.
- Some new license plans include site usage limits.
- Switching from your legacy license is permanent and cannot be reversed.
  
We recommend reviewing the new license options and their features on our pricing page before making your decision.
