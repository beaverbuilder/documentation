You can downgrade from one premium version either to another, or downgrade to the free Beaver Builder Lite plugin.

## Downgrade License

If you've purchased a Beaver Builder license, you may downgrade your license within 30 days of purchase. Upon downgrading, we'll refund the difference in price between the licenses.

For more information, please refer to our refund policy in the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/).

### Request a Downgrade

To request a downgrade, simply submit a support ticket and specify the plan you'd like to switch to. Please include the email address associated with your purchase or your subscription number to help us locate your account efficiently.

:::caution

Please note that downgrading will result in the loss of features from the higher-tier version. You can view the specific features of each plan on our [pricing page](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/pricing/).

For example, downgrading from the Professional license to the Starter license reduces your license usage from 50 sites to 1 site and removes Multisite Support and Multisite Network Settings.

:::

Once your downgrade has been processed and confirmed, you will have access to the new plugin version in your Beaver Builder Account area.

## Legacy Licenses

For users on legacy licenses (Standard, Pro, Agency, and Ultimate), your plan and pricing will remain unchanged as long as you continue renewing your subscription.

These legacy licenses are no longer available for new purchases or downgrades. If you wish to downgrade, we recommend allowing your legacy subscription to expire, after which you can select a plan from our current [pricing page](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/pricing/).

## Downgrade to Lite Version

Alternatively, you may opt to switch to our free Beaver Builder Lite Version plugin. To do so, navigate to the Plugins page, deactivate and delete the premium version, then [install the Lite version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/).
