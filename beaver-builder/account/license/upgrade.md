You can upgrade your license from one premium version to another at any time. When you upgrade, you’ll only be charged the cost difference between your license and the one you’re upgrading to, prorated to expire one year after your original purchase.

For example, if you buy a license on January 1 and upgrade on July 1, you will be charged for a half year of the difference between the two licenses' annual prices. The license expiration date remains the same, so on the following January 1, your license expires and you can renew at the price of your current package.

:::warning Legacy License Upgrades

When customers who are eligible for a renewal discount on their legacy plan choose to upgrade to one of our new plans, they should keep the following in mind:

- Renewal discounts associated with your legacy license will not carry over to the new plan.
- Some new license plans include site usage limits.
- Switching from your legacy license is permanent and cannot be reversed.
  
We recommend reviewing the new license options and their features on our pricing page before making your decision.
