In this article, we explain how your Beaver Builder license renewal works and why it is a good idea to renew it every year.

## Automatic Renewal

If you purchased Beaver Builder **after May 1st, 2017**, your license will renew automatically unless you [switched to manual renewal](#cancel-automatic-renewal).

:::info
If you purchased Beaver Builder **before May 1st, 2017**, you will need to manually renew your license from your account page. You’ll be able to renew one month before your subscription expires.
:::

## Cancel Automatic Renewal

If you are set up for autorenewal, you can cancel it, and when your subscription expires you can either manually renew or let your subscription lapse.

1. Go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and scroll to the **My Subscriptions** section.

2. Click the **Cancel Renewal** button next to the subscription you'd like to cancel.

:::info
If you don't see the **Cancel Renewal** button, it means you're not in the autorenewal program and you'll have to renew it manually each year.
:::

:::caution
We cannot reinstate auto-renewal if you cancel it later, but you can still renew manually.
:::

If you do not renew your Beaver Builder license, please refer to the [What happens if I don't renew?](#what-happens-if-i-dont-renew) section for more information.

## Renewal Discount

You're entitled to a 40% discount if you purchased Beaver Builder **before October 13, 2022**. Your subscription discount pricing will remain unchanged as long as you renew within 2 weeks of the expiration date.

You’ll receive an email the day your subscription expires with access to a renewal link. We will also send out a reminder email one week from the day your subscription expires.

If for some reason you don’t receive these emails, [contact us](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/contact/) and we’ll get you fixed right up!

## What happens if I don't renew?

If your Beaver Builder license expires, you won't have access to updates or the ability to download products from your account page. However, you can still install and use any copy you've already downloaded. Essentially, you're restricted to the Beaver Builder version available at the time your license expired. Furthermore, Beaver Builder Support won't be accessible to you in such a case.

:::caution

Keep in mind that we can't assure the compatibility of older versions of Beaver Builder with updated components like WordPress, PHP, or third-party plugins on your site.

Given these considerations, if you opt not to renew your license, we recommend considering migrating your content to an alternative solution.
