Beaver Builder comes with icon sets from three sources enabled by default:

  * Font Awesome 5
  * Foundation Icons
  * WordPress Dashicons

The Font Awesome 5 icon set is huge, so in **Settings > Beaver Builder > Icons** there are several choices for subsets of Font Awesome 5, shown in the following screenshot.

These choices match the choices available on the [Font Awesome website](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery). Each subset has a basic set for the free version and an extra set for the Pro version, except for the Light and Duotone subsets, which have Pro icons only. See [how to enable the Font Awesome Pro sets](/beaver-builder/styles/icons/enable-font-awesome-pro-icon-sets.md).

:::info
Beaver Builder supports the Font Awesome plugin. When it's activated, you can use that plugin's shortcodes in your Beaver Builder layouts, improve search in Beaver Builder editor's icon picker, and make it easier to add Font Awesome Pro icons. When the plugin is not activated, or for icon sets other than Font Awesome, only the icon slugs are searched.

You can enable or disable any of these built-in icon sets. You can also [create your own icon sets](/beaver-builder/styles/icons/create-and-import-a-custom-icon-set.md) and import them into Beaver Builder.

##  Enable or disable icon sets

This applies to both built-in and custom icon sets.

  1. On the WordPress admin panel, click **Settings > Beaver Builder**, then click the **Icons** tab.
  2. Select or clear checkboxes to enable or disable the icon sets.

## Delete a custom icon set

  1. Go to **Settings > Beaver Builder > Icons.**
  2. Click **Delete** next to the icon set you want to delete.   
This removes the custom icon set from loading in Beaver Builder, but it
doesn't remove it from the Media Library.

  3. To delete the icon set in the WordPress Media Library, go to **Media Library** from the WordPress admin panel and delete the custom icon set zip file.
