:::tip **Tip**
Radius and shadow effects apply whether or not a border line has been
set in the **General** section.

The **Radius** setting rounds the corners of the border box area to round the
corners of either the border line, if you set one, or the edges of a row,
column, or module background.

When you click any of the **Radius** value fields, a slider appears to quickly
adjust the value. You can make all four corners the same value by clicking the
**Link** icon. In the following animation, the slider is used to set the
radius that rounds the upper left corner, then the **Link** icon is clicked to
add the same setting to all four corners.

The **Box shadow** effect also works with sliders. Moving the **X** slider to
the left adds a background shadow to the left, and moving it to the right adds
a shadow to the right. You can also add blur to make it more shadow-like, and
increase the spread to change the size of the shadow.

:::info
Box shadows extend outside the row width. This means that for full-
width rows with margins set to **0**, the shadow will extend outside of the
browser window.
