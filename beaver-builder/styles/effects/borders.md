Rows, columns, and some modules have a **Border** section, as shown
in the following screenshot.

The Border section is divided into two main subsections:
* General  
  These settings apply to the standard border around an object, described in the next section.
* Radius & Shadow  
  These settings are described in the [Radius & Shadow article](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/radius-shadow.md).

The device icon  appears at the top of the **Border** section, so you can
adjust all of the border settings responsively for large, medium, and small
devices. If you don't add settings for each device size, the settings for the
desktop  apply to all sizes.

## The General subsection

The **General** subsection has the following settings, shown in this
screenshot and described below:

The **General** button has fields for the type of border, the color, and the
width of the line, set in pixels.

If you want all the width values to be the same, set a width for one edge and
click the **Link** icon next to the **Width** label to populate all of the
fields. The **Link** icon is a toggle, which means it will keep all of the
**Width** values in synch until you click the icon again.
