There are three aspects to translations:

  * Using POT files to get the translatable text for translations into new languages
  * Getting a translated version of the Beaver Builder Plugin and Theme
  * Building multilingual websites

## New translations

To facilitate new translations, Beaver Theme's translatable text is provided
in a POT file at _bb-theme/languages/fl-automator.pot_.

## Translated versions

The Beaver Builder Plugin and Theme are currently available in a number of
languages. Please visit the following links for an overview of which languages
Beaver Builder is currently translated in and how complete those translations
are.

  * [Beaver Builder Plugin](https://translate.wpbeaverbuilder.com/glotpress/projects/bb-plugin/)
  * [Beaver Builder Theme](https://translate.wpbeaverbuilder.com/glotpress/projects/bb-theme/)
  * [Beaver Themer](https://translate.wpbeaverbuilder.com/glotpress/projects/bb-theme-builder/)

We're always looking to increase the number of available translations, so let us know if you're interested in helping and we'll hook you up with a free year of our Pro membership. Please note we cannot comp a higher package of Beaver Builder. If a higher package is necessary, we can comp the Pro membership pricing and you will be responsible for the difference in pricing.

Beaver Builder is currently translated using GlotPress. To get access and
become a translator, please [contact us using this form](https://translate.wpbeaverbuilder.com/contact-the-administrator/).
