You can disable the ability to create child columns by adding the following line to your *wp-config.php* file

```php
define( 'FL_BUILDER_NESTED_COLUMNS', false );
```    

:::info
If you have any page that already has child columns, they will continue to work, and you can select and move the parent column. However, you will not be able to create any new child columns or to drag a column into another column.
