You can use shortcodes in **Layout CSS & JavaScript settings**, accessed from the [Tools menu](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/tools-menu.md). Use this feature to replace a value in custom CSS or JS in a Beaver Builder layout.

## Enable

1. Access your site's **WordPress Admin Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Beaver Builder**.
3. Then click the **Advanced** tab and toggle the **Render shortcodes in CSS/JS** option.

:::info
You can also enable this feature using the `fl_enable_shortcode_css_js` filter in your child theme's *functions.php* file:

```php
add_filter( 'fl_enable_shortcode_css_js', '__return_true' );
```

This filter prevents shortcodes markup flagging as an error.

## Examples

In the following examples, we demonstrate how to use field connection shortcodes in CSS, but any shortcode can be used.

### `[wpbb site:url]` in CSS

Suppose you have CSS for a background image for a page, such as:

```css
body {
    background: url("https://my-website.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/my-image.jpg");
    }
```

By using the Beaver Themer shortcode [`[wpbb site:url]`](/beaver-themer/field-connections/field-connection-shortcode-index-themer.md#site-url) to replace your site URL, you make it easier to migrate the code or the entire site to a new domain.

```css
body {
    background: url("[wpbb site:url]/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/my-image.jpg");
    }
```

### Conditional Logic

You can use field connection conditional logic in your CSS. In the example below, we can change the color of a post title based on whether the Advanced Custom Field field value is true or false.

```css
.fl-post-title {

    [wpbb-if post:acf type='text' name='FIELD NAME' exp='equals' value='SOME VALUE']

        color: red;

    [wpbb-else]

        color: yellow;

    [/wpbb-if]

}
```
