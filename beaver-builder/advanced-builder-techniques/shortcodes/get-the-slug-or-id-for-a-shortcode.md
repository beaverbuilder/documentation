To use a shortcode, you need to find the slug or ID of the layout template or
saved row, column, or module you want to insert.

**To get the slug or ID for a saved template, row, column, or module:**

1. From the WordPress admin panel, click **Beaver Builder**, then click **Templates**, **Saved Rows**, **Saved columns**, or **Saved Modules**.

  If you don't see **Beaver Builder** in the WordPress admin panel, see [this article](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/cant-find-the-beaver-builder-menu-in-the-admin-panel.md) on enabling it.

2. Click **Edit** beneath the template, row, column, or module that you want.  

3. Do either of the following to get the slug or ID.
   * To get the slug, copy the value in the **Slug** field, as shown in this screenshot.   

  If you don't see the **Slug** field, click **Screen Options** in the upper
  right corner and select the **Slug** checkbox.
