CSS breakpoints determine how a responsive layout behaves on different devices based on its width. You can use them to control when your layout can be adapted or to show or hide content based on a device's size.

## Desktop-first Approach

Beaver Builder takes a desktop-first approach. That is, you begin by designing for your desktop or Extra Large device layout and work your way down to smaller devices like tablets and smartphones. As a result, Beaver Builder uses the `max-width` expression in the breakpoint [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_mediaqueries.asp), as shown in the example below.

```css
@media (max-width: 1200px) {
  .fl-node-glvo1rmpjqa6.fl-module-heading .fl-heading {
    font-size: 48px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 992px) {
  .fl-node-glvo1rmpjqa6.fl-module-heading .fl-heading {
    font-size: 36px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .fl-node-glvo1rmpjqa6.fl-module-heading .fl-heading {
    font-size: 26px;
  }
}
```

## Default Breakpoints

Beaver Builder includes three breakpoints enabling you to fine-tune your layout for a variety of device sizes. The default breakpoint values [can be modified to suit your needs](#custom-breakpoints).

:::info
When a device's screen width exceeds 1200px, the Extra Large device size is used.
:::

### Small Device Breakpoint

The Small Device Breakpoint allows you to style your layouts for smaller devices, such as smartphones, mini tablets, and portrait-oriented tablets. Devices with a screen width of `768px` or less are considered small devices.

### Medium Device Breakpoint

The Medium Device Breakpoint allows you to style your layouts for medium devices, such as small desktop computers, some laptops, and tablets. Devices with a screen width between `769px` and `992px` are considered medium devices.

### Large Device Breakpoint

The Large Device Breakpoint allows you to style your layouts for large devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, and landscape-oriented tablets. Devices with a width between `993px` and `1200px` are considered large devices.

## Default Breakpoint Values

The default breakpoint values for each device size are:

* **Large** - `1200px`.
* **Medium** - `992px`.
* **Small** - `768px`.

## Custom Breakpoints

The default breakpoints in Beaver Builder can be customized to suit your needs. If you modify the default breakpoint values, those changes will be applied globally.

1. [Launch Beaver Builder](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/launch-builder.md) on a page or post.

2. Access the [Global Settings](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/global-settings.md#medium-device-breakpoint) from the [Tools menu](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/tools-menu.md).

3. Go to the **Responsive Layouts** sections and change the number of pixels for the Large, Medium, or Small device breakpoints.

4. Click **Save**.

:::tip
If the [Use Responsive Settings in Previews?](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/global-settings.md#use-responsive-settings-in-previews) setting in [Global Settings](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/global-settings.md) is enabled, custom breakpoints will be used in [Responsive Editor mode](editor.md).

## Landscape & Portrait Orientation

Although Beaver Builder breakpoints were chosen to accommodate the majority of popular device sizes and screen widths, they don't target every use case.

In many iPad models, the landscape orientation display dimensions are `1024x768` pixels, and a portrait orientation display width of `768x1024` pixels, making landscape orientation a [large](#large-device-breakpoint) device and portrait orientation a [small](#small-device-breakpoint) device.

![Landscape and Portrait Orientation diagram](/img/beaver-builder/responsive-design--breakpoints--2.jpg)

By changing the Small Device Breakpoint value from `768px` to `767px`, you can make the iPad's portrait orientation a medium device. You can then use the [Visibility](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/visibility.md) setting on the [Advanced tab](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) to display one row for tablets in both orientations, but a separate row for phones.
