Reusable Content lets you save rows, columns, and modules so you can quickly reuse them across your site. This helps you build pages faster, keep designs consistent, and simplify updates. Whether you need flexible templates, synchronized global content, or a mix of both with components, Reusable Content gives you the tools to manage and maintain your layouts more efficiently.

## Why use Reusable Content?

- Ensure consistency by updating shared items once and applying changes everywhere.
- Save time by creating a design or content block once and reusing it across pages.
- Simplify maintenance with single-source updates that reduce errors and outdated content.
- Stay flexible with Components that lock design while allowing per-page customization.
- Use reusable content anywhere, from pages and posts to modules like Accordions or Tabs, or even theme files using shortcodes.

## Types of Reusable Content

You can choose from three types, Template, Global, and Component, each offering unique benefits to suit different design needs.

- [**Templates**](templates.md)  
Templates, identified by a **blue overlay outline**, let you reuse saved content items as a starting point. Each time you use a template item, you can make changes without affecting the original or other instances of that item across your site.  

- [**Globals**](globals.md)  
Globals, shown with an **orange overlay outline**, keep saved content items synchronized. When you update a global item, the changes automatically apply everywhere it’s used, ensuring identical content across your site.  

- [**Components**](components.md)  
Components, marked by a **purple overlay outline**, let you define which settings remain fixed and which can be changed. For example, you can keep the styling of a saved content item fixed while allowing the content to be updated, or lock specific styling options while leaving others adjustable. This flexibility is ideal when you want to maintain a consistent design while still allowing content variations.  

## Choosing the right type

- Use Templates when you want full flexibility to make unique changes.
- Use Globals when you need content to always stay the same across multiple pages.
- Use Components when you want a mix of consistency and customization.

## Converting Types

You cannot directly convert a Reusable Content item from one type to another. However, you can add the item to your page, save it as a new item, choose the desired type, and then replace the original.

1. Add the Reusable Content item to your page.  
2. Open the **Settings** window and click **Save As...**.  
3. Enter a new name, select the desired type, and save the item.  
4. Delete the original item if it is no longer needed.

You can confirm that a reusable content item has been converted by checking the color of its Beaver Builder overlay outline:  

- **Blue** — Template  
- **Orange** — Global  
- **Purple** — Component
