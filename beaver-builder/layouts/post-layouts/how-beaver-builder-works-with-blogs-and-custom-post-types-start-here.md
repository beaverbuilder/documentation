Both the Beaver Builder Plugin and Theme play a role in configuring the page
and content layout of your blog. We've broken down this big topic into a
number of smaller articles. Here's how they fit together.

1. If you're a WordPress novice, it's important to know the difference between a post and a static page, and [which components of WordPress and Beaver Builder handle the content area versus other parts of a page or post](/beaver-builder/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-builder.md/#plugin-vs-theme-vs-beaver-themer).

2. Follow these links for a simple refresher on [what archives are](/beaver-builder/layouts/post-layouts/wordpress-archive-types.md) and [how WordPress handles blogs](/beaver-builder/layouts/post-layouts/basics-how-wordpress-handles-blog-posts-and-archives.md).

3. If you [enable Beaver Builder for posts or custom post types](/beaver-builder/management-migration/control-which-post-types-can-use-beaver-builder.md), you can [use Beaver Builder to add layouts to the content area of single posts](/beaver-builder/layouts/post-layouts/use-beaver-builder-to-lay-out-post-content.md).

4. The Beaver Builder Theme has a number of [Customizer settings](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/content.md) that apply outside the post's content area and determine whether or not the page has a sidebar and what types of post information are displayed. You can also [change the page template on single posts](/bb-theme/getting-started/built-in-theme-templates-for-single-pages-and-posts.md) to full width or no header/footer.

5. Instead of or in addition to the standard [generated WordPress index and archive pages](/beaver-builder/layouts/post-layouts/generated-wordpress-archives-versus-beaver-builder-layouts.md), you can use any of the [Posts modules](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts-posts-carousel-and-posts-slider-modules-examples.md) in Beaver Builder layouts to create lists of posts on static pages. If you use a Posts module instead of a generated archive, it may change [how you configure WordPress to handle your blog settings](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/blog-settings/configure-how-wordpress-handles-your-blog.md).  

6. If you're comfortable adding code, you can [add Beaver Builder saved rows or modules above or below the post content area](/beaver-builder/layouts/post-layouts/add-rows-and-modules-to-index-archive-and-post-pages.md).

7. If you have [Beaver Themer](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/) (the premium add-on for Beaver Builder), you can create layouts for generated [archives](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/archive-layout-type/themer-archive-layout-type.md) or layouts outside the content area for any [single post](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/singular-layout-type/themer-singular-layout-type.md), or layouts such as banners [at specific locations on the page](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/part-layout-type/themer-part-layout-type.md). Beaver Themer also has integrations to help you design layouts for [WooCommerce](/beaver-themer/integrations/woocommerce/create-an-archive-themer-layout-for-woocommerce.md), [BigCommerce](/beaver-themer/integrations/bigcommerce/beaver-themer-layouts-for-bigcommerce.md), [The Events Calendar](/beaver-themer/integrations/tec/getting-started.md), and [Easy Digital Downloads](/beaver-themer/integrations/easy-digital-downloads/beaver-themer-and-the-edd-plugin.md).
