If you're not familiar with a Ken Burns effect, you can see what it looks like
by adding the Agency landing page template to a layout and scrolling down to
the "Joybilly Branding" section. Here's a preview:

The Ken Burns effect starts with implementing a slideshow as a row background
with a minimum of two images. Here's how.

**To create a Ken Burns effect:**

  1. Open the row for editing in the Beaver Builder editor.
  2. In the **Background** section, for **Type** choose **Slideshow**.
  3. In the **Photos** field, click **Add photos** and create a gallery with at least two images.
  4. Set **Speed** to the number of seconds you want each image to display.
  5. For **Transition**, select **Ken Burns**.
  6. Set **Transition speed** to the number of seconds that each photo transitions to the next.
  7. If you want the photos to display randomly instead of in the gallery order, set **Randomize photos** to **Yes**.
