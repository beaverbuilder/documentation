You can edit or delete your saved layout templates either through the **Beaver
Builder** admin panel or from within the Beaver Builder editor.

:::info
Editing or deleting a saved layout template has no effect on any
pages using that template.

## Edit or delete a saved layout template through the Beaver Builder menu

  1. In the WordPress admin panel, click **Beaver Builder > Templates.**  
If you don't see **Beaver Builder** in the admin panel, see [this article](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/cant-find-the-beaver-builder-menu-in-the-admin-panel.md) on enabling it.

  2. Mouse over the template that you want to edit or delete, then click **Trash** to move the template to the trash, or click **Beaver Builder** to open the page for editing.  
If you moved the template to the trash, you're done at this point.

  3. If you're editing the template, make any changes in the Beaver Builder editor, then click **Done > Publish**.

:::info
Deleted templates remain available in the trash until you
permanently delete them.

## Edit or delete a custom layout template within the Beaver Builder editor

You can edit or delete any saved template on the Templates tab when a page is
open for editing in Beaver Builder.

**To edit or delete a saved template from a Beaver Builder editing page:**

  1. From a page open for editing in Beaver Builder, in the **Content** panel, click **Templates**, then select the **Saved templates** group.
  2. Mouse over the template you want to edit or delete until the **Wrench** and **Trash** icons appear.
  3. Click the **Trash** icon to move the template to the trash.  
You're done at this point.

  4. To edit the item, click the **Wrench** icon.  
The layout template opens in Beaver Builder in a new tab. Note the URL changes
to *mydomain.com/fl-builder-template/....* to show you are editing a template.

  5. Make any editing changes, you want, then click **Done > Publish.**  
The tab for the layout template closes and you can go back to the page you
were editing.

Remember, the edited template does not update any existing templates, so if
you want to update the page you're editing, you'll need to follow the normal
procedure to use the edited template to append to or replace the existing
layout.

:::tip **Tip**
When you edit a template, previous versions are saved, so you can
[restore a previous version](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/restore-a-previous-version.md) if you need to.
