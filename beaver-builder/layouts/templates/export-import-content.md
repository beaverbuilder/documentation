This article provides steps on how to export and import your Beaver Builder content, such as templates, saved rows, columns, and modules, to your other websites. You can achieve this by using either the WordPress Import & Export Tools or the Assistant plugin and cloud service.

## WordPress Import & Export Tools

Using the WordPress Import and Export Tools, you can export your Beaver Builder content, including templates, saved rows, columns, and modules, and import them into another website.

You can choose to export individual templates, rows, columns, or modules, or the entire set altogether. This feature lets you create a group of templates on one WordPress install or staging area, and then effortlessly move them to other locations or bundle them for different purposes, such as migration, resale, or distribution.

### Import Content

To import custom templates, saved rows, columns, and modules.

1. Access your site's WordPress Admin Dashboard.

4. On the WordPress Importer page, select the `.xml` file that you exported, then click **Upload file and import**.

### Tips

* **Global content**  
  If you export a post or page that contains a global row, column, or module, it's a good idea to export the saved row, column, or module as well. That way, when you import the post or page, the global rows, columns, and modules can be relinked to the master template on the new site.

* **Images & icons**  
  Images and icon sets used by the templates, rows, columns, or modules you're exporting are not migrated with the template. You'll have to add them to the new location after import. Likewise, the theme at the new site will control the default font families, colors, and so on.

* **Links**  
  Links are not updated automatically in the imported template.

* **Migration**  
  If you're migrating an entire website from one domain to another (for example, you're migrating a development site to production), we recommend either using a migration plugin or following [our instructions to migrate a site to another domain](/beaver-builder/management-migration/manually-migrate-a-beaver-builder-site/) instead of moving templates.

## Assistant

If the WordPress Import and Export tools are not your preferred option, you can utilize Assistant instead. With Assistant, you can store and organize all your templates in a secure location, which makes importing them into your other websites a breeze.

See the Assistant [Libraries](/assistant/plugin/apps/libraries) and [Import](/assistant/plugin/apps/libraries#import-content) articles for more information.
