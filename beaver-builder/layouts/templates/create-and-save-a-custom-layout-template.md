You can create a custom layout template from a page you have already designed
in Beaver Builder (including a Themer layout), or you can create a layout
template from scratch starting from the **Beaver Builder** admin panel.

:::tip **Tip**
If you want to use a layout from one page to create another within
your site, you can [duplicate the page](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/duplicate-your-beaver-builder-layout-to-another-page.md) rather than saving a layout template.
Duplication creates a copy of your current page, including metadata.
:::

**To save an existing page in Beaver Builder as a custom layout template:**

  1. On the **Tools** menu, click **Save template**.  
The **Tools** menu is in the upper left corner of your screen. You can access
it by clicking the down arrow in the title bar.

  2. Give the template a name and click **Save**.

**To create a new custom layout template from the Beaver Builder admin
panel:**

  1. In the WordPress admin panel, go to **Beaver Builder > Templates**.  
If you don't see **Beaver Builder** in the admin panel, see [this article](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/cant-find-the-beaver-builder-menu-in-the-admin-panel.md) on enabling it.

  2. Click the **Add new** button next to the page title **Templates**.
  3. Enter a title for the template and click **Add saved template**.
  4. Click **Launch Beaver Builder** and construct the layout.
  5. To save the layout template, click **Done > Publish**.
