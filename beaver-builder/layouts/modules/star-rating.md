## Usage

Easily display feedback and highlight quality across your site with customizable star ratings. Adjust the number of stars, style, size, and color to match your design, creating a seamless way to showcase satisfaction and credibility. Common use cases include:

- Displaying customer ratings within testimonial sections.
- Showcasing product or service ratings on sales pages.
- Adding star ratings to pricing tables for comparison.
- Highlighting feedback in review or case study layouts.
- Enhancing landing pages with visual trust indicators.

## Settings

The Star Rating module consists of two primary settings tabs: General, and Style, along with the customary Advanced tab.

### General

The General tab lets you control the total number of stars, set the rating, and choose the star icon.

- **Total Stars** - Enter a numeric value to define the total number of stars to display.
- **Start Rating** - Enter a numeric value to set the star rating, which determines the displayed rating. This value cannot exceed the Total Stars setting.
- **Star Icon** - Choose the star rating icon you want to use. You can select from any icons available in your installed and enabled icon library sets, such as Font Awesome.

### Style

The Style tab allows you to customize the star rating, including fill and background colors, alignment, size, and spacing. It is divided into two sections: Colors, where you control the fill, background, and border settings, and Layout, where you adjust alignment, size, and spacing.

- **Colors**  
  
  - **Star Fill**: Sets the color of the filled stars that represent the actual rating value.  
  - **Star Background**: Sets the color of the unfilled stars, representing the remaining stars up to the total number set.  
  - **Star Border**: Sets the border color of the star icons, applied to both the filled stars representing the rating and the unfilled stars representing the total number.

- **Layout**  
  
  - **Star Alignment**: Choose the alignment of the stars (left, center, or right).  
  - **Star Size**: Set the size of the star rating icons.  
  - **Star Spacing**: Adjust the space between each star rating icon.  
  - **Star Stroke**: Set the border stroke for the star icons.  
  
## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
