description: The Sidebar module creates a WordPress sidebar in a Beaver Builder layout, containing any set of WordPress widgets that your theme allows.
---

The Sidebar module gives you the ability to insert any of your WordPress
sidebars into your layouts.

The widgets in the sidebar can be configured by going to **Appearance > Widgets** in the WordPress admin panel.

:::info
The Beaver Builder Theme has only one sidebar, called the Primary
Sidebar. If you want to create a different sidebar or which widgets appear
there, you must use a plugin or write code.
:::

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
