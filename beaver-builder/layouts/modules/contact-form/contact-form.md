---

The Contact Form module displays a basic contact form with the following properties:

  * The form can display **Name**, **Subject**, **Email**, **Phone**, and **Message** fields.  
The labels and placeholder text for these fields can be customized.
  * By default, the **Name** and **Email** fields are displayed, and the **Subject** and **Phone** fields are hidden.   
Any fields that are displayed are required.
  * There's an optional **Terms and Conditions** checkbox.  
You can add custom text above the checkbox and customize the checkbox label, as in the following screenshot.  
If you enable the checkbox, users must select the checkbox to submit the form successfully. If they don't, they receive the message "You must accept the Terms and Conditions." One use for this checkbox is to meet GDPR requirements if you feel users must
explicitly accept terms and conditions.

  * You can [add a Google reCaptcha button](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/contact-form/add-a-google-recaptcha-checkbox-to-a-form.md) to the form to deter spam.
  * The user can submit the form with either the spacebar or the Enter key.
  * You can choose whether the person who submits the form sees a confirmation message or is redirected to a URL you specify.
  * Email notifications are automatically sent to the designated recipient upon form submission.

:::info
Entries from this form are not stored in the database or added to your website files. If you need a
more central or permanent record of contacts than the email notifications, use a third-party form
plugin.

### Captcha tab

### Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.

## Accessibility

For the contact form input fields, the `aria-describedby` attribute is used to indicate the IDs of the elements that describe the object. The label and placeholder text can be shown, hidden, or customized, so the value of the `aria-describedby` attribute for each input field in the form is the ID of the error that appears if the field is not filled in.

For example, the following code is the HTML output produced for the **Name** field in a contact form with the default labels, placeholders, and the **Show placeholders only** setting.

```html
<div class="fl-input-group fl-name">
		<label for="fl-name" class="hidden">Your name</label>
		<span class="fl-contact-error" id="name-error">Please enter your name.</span>
		<input type="text" id="fl-name" name="fl-name" aria-describedby="name-error" value="" placeholder="Your name">
	</div>
```

Because the setting is **Show placeholders only**, the `label` tag is assigned the CSS class `hidden`, and the CSS rule for that class is `display:none`, which causes most screen readers ignore the content of that tag.

In contrast, here's the output when **Show labels/placeholders** is set to **Show labels only**:

```html
<div class="fl-input-group fl-name">
		<label for="fl-name">Your name</label>
		<span class="fl-contact-error" id="name-error">Please enter your name.</span>
		<input type="text" id="fl-name" name="fl-name" aria-describedby="name-error" value="" placeholder="">
	</div>
```
In this case, the content in the `<label>` tag is visible to the screen reader, the `<input>` tag's `placeholder` attribute has no value, and the `aria-describedby` value is still the ID of the error message.
