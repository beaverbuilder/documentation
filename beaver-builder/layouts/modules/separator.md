The Separator module inserts a horizontal line to separate content.

## **General** tab

* **Color**  
By default, the line is a light gray color.
* **Height** (responsive)  
   This is the thickness of the line style.  For double lines, as the **Height** value increases, the thickness of both lines and the space between them increases. This setting can be set differently for each device size. By default, the height is 1px.
* **Width** (responsive)  
The width of the line relative to row width. You can choose a **%**, **px**, or **vw** unit of measurement. See [the article on relative units of measurement](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/css-length-height-units.md). By default, the line is 100% wide.
* **Alignment** (left, center, right) (responsive)
* **Style**  
The choices are **Solid**, **Dashed**, **Dotted**, **Double**.

:::info
The **Double** line style must have a height of at least 3px set to display as a double line.
