The Callout and Call to Action modules are very similar, as shown in this
screenshot, with a heading, some text, and a button, but their uses are often
different.

## Uses of these modules

With the Call to Action module, the emphasis is usually on the button. The
point is to get the visitor to click the button to take an action on your
website. Often much of the preceding page is the lead-in to funnel the visitor
into wanting to click that button. By that point, no image and little text is
required. It's the final action of a persuasive presentation.

The callout module tends to be used in groups, often to highlight the features
of a business that send the visitor to the appropriate page of the site.
Here's an example of a grouping of Callout modules. Although you could
construct the same look with a Photo module, Heading module, Text Editor
module, and Button module, the Callout module keeps it of these parts together
nicely on smaller devices, and it automatically adds the link to the image and
the heading as well as to the button to facilitate getting to the right
location.

## Properties of the Call to Action and Callout modules

Both modules offer:

  * A heading and a text editor for optional text.
  * A button with the ability to configure button style.
  * An optional icon on the button with the ability to position it relative to the text.

They differ in the following ways:

  * The Callout module allows an optional image or icon, with the ability to position it above, below, left, or right of the text.
  * In the Call to Action module, the button is required; in the Callout module it is optional, and there is an option for linked text instead of a button, or neither one.
  * In the Callout module, the link you specify applies to the heading, the image, and the button. In the Call to Action module, only the button has the link.
  * There are some minor styling differences. For example, the Call to Action module allows you to adjust the spacing above and below it.

Here are some more examples of Callout and Call to Action modules with
buttons. Here's a Callout module with the image on the left and an icon on the
button, plus a border.

![](/img/callout-3.jpg)

Here's the same Callout module with an icon instead of an image. The icon can
be placed in a number of positions relative to the heading and text.

![](/img/callout-4.jpg)

And here's the same content in a Call to Action module placed in a column,
with the border set on the column. The icon can only appear on the button, and
there is no provision for adding an image, though you can add one as a column
or row background, as shown in the version on the right.

Aside from the ability to set vertical space above and below the Call to
Action, the Callout module is more powerful and more flexible.

## Other uses of the Callout module

You can position the image in various locations with respect to the text.
Here's an example in which the images are positioned over the text.

A big advantage of using the Callout module for image-text groupings is that
they stay together and stack correctly at smaller device sizes.

## Call to Action module settings

### General tab

This tab has fields to enter the heading and text portion of the call to
action. You can also specify the **Heading tag** that you want used (H1, H2,
etc.). If you want to enter a custom font size, you can do that in the
**Typography** section of the **Style** tab.

### Style tab

The **Style** tab has three sections, as shown in the following screenshot and
described below.

![](/img/callout-8.png)

#### 1 Top section

  * **Layout**  
**Stacked** : the heading appears above the text, which appears above the
button.  
**Inline** : the heading a text appear to the left of the button.

  * **Background color**  
Fills the module background with the designated color. If you have Beaver
Themer, this field has a field connection (the Plus icon) to let you use a
custom field to assign the color for the particular post or page the layout
applies to.

  * **Border** (responsive)  
This is the standard Border section, to attach a [border](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/borders.md) or [border effect](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/radius-shadow.md).

  * **Alignment**  
Left, center, or right horizontal alignment, or default alignment if none of
the three choices are selected. See [this article](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/alignment.md) for more
information.

  * **Padding (responsive)**  
The distance from the module's border to its content, in **px**, **em**, or
**%** units. You can enter these values per device size by clicking the device
icon or entering **Responsive Editing Mode**. See [this article](/beaver-builder/layouts/responsive-design/index.md) for more information about responsive editing.

#### 2 **Heading** section

Settings for the heading portion of the call to action:

* **Heading color**  
Opacity is set with the right-hand slider in the [Color Picker](/beaver-builder/styles/colors/color-picker.md).
* [**Heading Typography** section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md) (responsive)  
Includes various font settings and a text shadow effect.

#### **3 Text** section

Settings for the text portion of the call to action: **Text color** and the
**Typography** section.

## Callout module settings

### General tab

This tab has fields to enter the heading and text portion of the call to
action. You can also specify the heading tag that you want used (H1, H2,
etc.). If you want to enter a custom font size, you can do that in the
**Typography** section of the **Style** tab.

### Style tab

The **Style** tab for the Callout module is identical to that for the Call to
Action module. See the previous section for a description of the fields.

###  Image tab

On the **Image** tab, the settings are different depending on whether you
select a photo or an icon in the **Image type** field.

#### Photos

Setting **Image type** to **Photo** opens two sections: **Photo** and **Photo
style**.

The **Photo** section has the following fields:

  * **Photo**  
Select the photo and the maximum photo size. The photo size can be customized
in the **Width** field of the **Photo style** section.

  * **Position**  
You can choose for the photo to appear above or below the heading or to the
left or right of the text and heading. If there's also a button or link, the
photo is vertically centered to the left or right.

The **Photo style** section has the following fields:

  * **Photo crop**  
You can crop the photo into a specific shape.

  * **Width**  
Choose a custom max width for the photo in **px**, **vw**, or **%**. If you
don't enter a value here, the max width will be determined by the photo size
you selected in the **Photo** section.

  * **Alignment** (responsive)  
Sets the [alignment](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/alignment.md) for the photo within its column space. If the photo
placement is over or under, this aligns the photo to the left, center or right
over the heading and text. If the photo placement is to the left or right,
this aligns the photo in the left column.   
**Tip:** To move the left or right photo closer to the heading and text,
adjust the settings in the **Padding** field on the **Style** tab.

  * **Border**   
Standard settings for [border](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/borders.md) and [border effects](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/radius-shadow.md). Setting **Radius** rounds
the corners of the photo.

####  Icons

Setting **Image type** to **Icon** opens three sections: **Icon**, **Icon
colors**, and **Icon style**.

The **Icon** section has the following fields.

  * **Icon**  
[Select the icon](/beaver-builder/styles/icons/enable-disable-or-delete-icon-sets.md).

  * **Position**  
You can choose for the icon to appear above or below the heading or to the
left or right of just the heading or the heading and text both. If there's
also a button or link, the photo is vertically centered to the left or right.

**Note:**

With any of the left or right selections, the icon position is vertically
centered with the heading. The difference between **Left/Right of Heading**
and **Left/Right of Heading and Text** is that with the former, the text and
optional button or link are aligned under both the heading and icon, whereas
in the latter, the text and optional button remain aligned under the heading,
and the icon appears to the left or right of that grouping. The following
screenshot shows an example in which the overall alignment (on the **Style**
tab) is set to **Right**.

![](/img/callout-10.png)

The **Icon colors** section has the following fields:

  * **Color**  
If this color is unspecified, the default accent color is used. For Beaver
Builder Theme, this is set in the Customizer at **General > Accent Color**.

  * **Hover color**  
If this color is unspecified, the default accent color is used. For Beaver
Builder Theme, this is set in the **Hover colo** r field in Customizer at
**General > Accent Color**.

  * **Background color**  
Setting a background color adds a circle with a border behind the icon, as
shown in the screenshot. If this color is unspecified no color is added.  
![](/img/callout-11.png)

  * **Background hover color**  
Sets the background color on hover. If this field is not set, the **Background
color** setting is used.

  * **Gradient**  
Sets a gradient on the background color, if there is one. The screenshot above
shows a gradient on the background color, which is lighter at the top and
darker at the bottom.

### Link tab

In the **Link** section, setting a link adds a hyperlink to the heading, the
photo or icon, and the button or link text.

In the **Call to Action** section, the **Type** field has the following
choices:

  * **None**  
Does not display either a button or link text. however, if you have set a
link, that link will still be set on the heading and a photo or icon.

  * Link  
Choosing **Link** opens a **Text** field and a **Link text** section, as shown
in the following screenshot and described below.  
![](/img/callout-12.png)  
The **Link text** section lets you assign link and link hover color, and the
**Link typography** subsection is the [standard **Typography** section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md).

  * **Button  
**This choice opens a **Text** field and a number of button sections, as shown
in the following screenshot.  
![](/img/callout-13.png)  
These button sections have most of the same options of the [Button module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/button/button.md).

### Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
