The Countdown module displays a visual timer that counts down to zero for a date and time that you specify. Scroll down to see screenshots.

## General tab

You can specify the target date and time, including choosing the timezone that
should be used.

## Style tab
This tab has a top section of settings, followed by several sections that vary depending on the type of layout you select.

### Top section

* **Layout**  
  The choices are:  
  * **Numbers**
  This setting includes numbers plus the text under the numbers for each unit of measurement (days, hours, minutes, seconds).

  *  **Numbers \+ Circles**  
  Adds a circle around the numbers that visually shows the time remaining: number of seconds left in a minute, minutes left in an hour, hours left in a day, days, left in a year.

* **Alignment**  
This is the standard [horizontal alignment toggle](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/alignment.md), which can be set to different alignments on large, medium, and small devices.

### **Numbers and Text** section

* **Number color**
* **Number typography**  
The standard [Typography section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md) for the numbers displayed.
* **Text color**
* **Text typography**  
The standard [Typography section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md) for the text displayed under the numbers.
* **Horizontal padding** (**Numbers** layout only)  
Padding
* **Vertical padding** (**Numbers** layout only)
* **Number spacing**  
Used in both types of layout to increase or decrease the left and right margins for individual numbers.

The following screenshot shows a **Numbers** layout with the **Horizontal padding**, **Vertical padding**, and **Number spacing** settings mapped onto a [CSS box](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/spacing.md). The padding settings are associated with the `fl-countdown-unit` class, whereas the left-right spacing is associated with the  `fl-countdown-number` class.

With the **Numbers \+ Circles** layout, only the **Number spacing** setting is available, so you can set only the left and right margins between numbers, shown in this screenshot.

:::tip **Tips**
* If the **Circle size** and **Circle Stroke** size are too large, they can overlap, as you can see in the screenshot. Check vertical spacing in responsive mode, as well as horizontal spacing in all modes â€“ or make use of the overlap for effect!
* To control the space between the numbers and the circle, use the **Circle size** setting in the **Circle styles** section described below.

This section appears for the **Numbers** layout only.

* **Number background color**  
Inserts a square of color behind the color/unit pair.
* **Number border radius**

### **Separator** section (**Numbers** layout only)

Choose **Yes** to show a separator between each time unit.
* **Separator Type**  
You can choose a colon or a pipe symbol as a separator.
* **Separator color**

### **Circle styles** section (**Numbers \+ Circles** layout only)

* **Circle foreground color**  
Displays the amount of time remaining in each time unit.
* **Circle background color**  
Displays the portion of the circle not taken up by the foreground color.
