sidebar_label: Posts Slider module
description: The Posts Slider module displays a set of posts or pages that display one at a time, either sliding or fading to the next slide.
---

In the Posts Slider module, a set of posts or pages is displayed with either a
sliding or a fade-in animation. The featured image of each post becomes the
background image in the slide (unless you select the option to hide it), with
post info and content overlaid on the slide. See examples of Posts Slider
layouts in [this article](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts-slider.md).

:::info
Some features are distributed across more than one tab. For example,
you can set the featured image to display as a thumbnail instead of a
background on the **Layout** tab. On the **Style** tab, you can then set the
post title, post info, and excerpt to appear to the left or right of the
thumbnail.

## Slider tab

| Section             | Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &nbsp;              | Height           | Minimum height of the posts slider. The height will expand to fit the photo being displayed.<br/> **Tip:** If you don't like the expanding and shrinking to accommodate various photo heights, preprocess your photos so they are all the same height.                                                |
| &nbsp;              | Auto play        | If **Yes**, the display moves through the posts automatically, unless the user intervenes by clicking on the dots or arrows or moving the cursor over one of the posts. If **No**, there is no animation and user must use the navigational aids.                                                     |
| &nbsp;              | Delay            | Number of seconds each post is displayed. This setting is used only if **Auto play** is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| &nbsp;              | Loop             | If **Yes**, the list of posts is displayed in a repeating continuous carousel. If **No**, the list of posts ends when the last post is reached. This behavior occurs whether autoplay is enabled or not.                                                                                              |
| &nbsp;              | Transition       | Choose the type of animation for the transition to the next post: **Fade** or **Slide**.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| &nbsp;              | Transition speed | When autoplay is enabled, the speed in seconds at which one slide moves to the next when the **Delay** time has finished.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| &nbsp;              | Number of posts  | Maximum number of posts to display. Which posts are selected depends on the filters set on the **Content** tab.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Slider controls** | Show dots        | If **Yes**, a set of horizontal dots is displayed at the bottom of the carousel. The number of dots equals the **Number of posts** value, and one dot is highlighted to indicate which post in the sequence is being displayed. Visitors can manually change the display by clicking one of the dots. |
| &nbsp;              | Show arrows      | If **Yes**, a left and right arrow is displayed on either side of the post list so user can move ahead or back manually. You can style the arrow color, background color, and background shape on the **Style** tab.                                                                                  |

Choose **Hide** to show only text with a solid color background.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Featured image (appears when featured image is set to Show)** | Image                | Display image as the slide background or as a thumbnail. **Thumbnail** displays the post title and post info to the left and the featured image thumbnail to the right in each slide.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This setting doesn't change the amount of crop. Increasing mage size increases the size of the file loaded, which can affect page load time. |
| &nbsp;                                                          | Crop                 | (Appears when **Image** is set to **Thumbnail**)<br/> Crops the featured image to a particular shape. Note that this may cut out some parts of the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

(The text background width is the width of the text plus padding.) See examples [in the Posts Slider section of this article](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts-posts-carousel-and-posts-slider-modules-examples.md/#posts-slider-module).<br/> **Note:** When **Position** in the **Text** section on the **Style** tab is set to **Bottom** , the text background effect will always be the equivalent of the **Auto** setting, even when set to **100%**. |

The default for a standard Beaver Builder layout is **Custom query**, which enables all the other fields on this tab.<br/> In Beaver Themer, the default is **Main query**, because normally for a Themer layout you want the query for posts to be based on whatever archive page the query is created for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

If you select either the alphabetic or numeric **Meta value** option, a **Meta key** field appears so you can enter the key (`meta_key`).                 |
| &nbsp;           | Offset                       | Enter an integer if you want to skip a certain number of posts in the order specified in the **Order** setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| &nbsp;           | Exclude current post         | Excludes the current post from the query. This is useful when you are using the module to create a list of related posts on a single post page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Filter**       | Posts, Pages, Products, etc. | (The label matches the single post name for the **Post type** you set)<br/> Include or exclude a set of posts, page, products, etc., by title. Start typing a word, and the titles containing that word will be displayed for you to choose. Keep selecting titles until you have the set you want to include or exclude. You can reorder matched selections and they are reflected in the front end. See an example for the Posts module at [Selection Order in Filtering](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts.md#selection-order-in-filtering). |
| &nbsp;           | Categories                   | (Hidden when the **Post type** setting is **Pages**)<br/> You can include or exclude categories to display.<br/> The third setting, **Match related categories except**, is useful in Singular-type Themer layouts when you want to use the Posts module to display a list of related posts, and you want to display the related posts in a family of categories except for the specific categories that you name.                                                                                                                                        |
| &nbsp;           | Tags                         | (Hidden when the **Post type** setting is **Pages** )<br/> You can include or exclude tags to display. The choices are the same as for including or excluding categories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| &nbsp;           | Authors                      | You can include or exclude posts or pages by specific authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
