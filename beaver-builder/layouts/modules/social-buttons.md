:::info
The Social Buttons module is no longer displayed in the content
panel by default in the Beaver Builder editor. We recommend a plugin such as
[Scriptless Social Sharing](https://wordpress.org/plugins/scriptless-social-sharing/) to display social icons in content layouts. If you're using the Social Buttons module in a layout, it will continue to work. If you want to add the Social Buttons module to a layout, go to **Settings > Beaver Builder > Modules** and select the **Social buttons** checkbox to enable it in the
Modules list in the editor.
:::

Use the Social Buttons module to let visitors share, like, or post content to
their own social network pages and automatically inserts a link to the current
page or any other URL you specify, such as the home page for your site.

The Social Buttons module includes Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, and you can
choose which to display. Note that the social buttons use the branding of each
social site.
