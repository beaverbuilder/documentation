description: The Menu module inserts any WordPress menu into your layout, with many layout and style options that can be tailored for responsiveness.
---

The Menu module can give you more options for menu content, style, and layout than the menu available in your theme or widget area. It also gives you the ability to insert a menu anywhere in your layout.

The Menu module displays items from [a WordPress menu that you designate](#menu). It has [several choices of layout](#layout). Menu alignment, colors, and typography are set on [the **Style** tab](#style-everything).

## Ideas for using a Menu module

* Use special menus in your Beaver Builder page layouts. For example, if you have one group of static pages on your site related to a particular topic, you could create a special menu for the pages in that particular group and display the links in a Menu module on the main page in that group.
* Save a Menu module and [use it in a shortcode in a text widget](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/shortcodes/use-shortcodes-in-your-layouts.md#add-beaver-builder-shortcode-to-a-wordpress-text-widget). There's a Custom Menu widget in WordPress, but the menu module gives you more control over styling without resorting to CSS.
* If you have FAQs that contain fairly long answers, create a separate post for each individual FAQ, then create a menu item for each post, then use that menu in a Menu module embedded in your page content. That menu serves as a table of contents linking to the post that contains the answer. The following screenshot shows an example of a menu used as an FAQ table of contents.

## General tab

### Menu

In the **Menu** field, choose the  WordPress menu that you have defined in **Appearance > Menus** from the WordPress admin panel. This menu defines which items are displayed in the menu.

If the website has no menu, this field says **No menu found** with a link to add one, which opens **Appearance > Menus** in a new tab. When you're finished, close the additional tab and reload your layout page in the previous tab to display the new menu choice.

### Layout

The **Layout** setting has four layout options, described in detail in the following sections.

On large screens, **Horizontal** layouts tend to work better in wide short columns, while **Vertical**, **Accordion**, and **Expanded** layouts tend to work better in narrow tall columns.

Why? The horizontal layout's menu boundary is fit to the menu items. In the following screenshot, you can see a horizontal menu with a color background, inside its column.

![](/img/menu-module-horizontal-layout-in-column.png)

The following screenshot shows a vertical layout with a color background in the same column. The menu's boundary is sized to fill the column width and the submenu and search icons are right-justified.  You can adjust the width of the module by changing the column width or adding margins or padding to the containing row or column, or increase the margin of the Menu module itself.

![](/img/menu-module-vertical-layout-in-column.png)

The Accordion and Expanded layouts look the same as the vertical layout. Their differences lie in how their submenus behave.

#### Layout: Horizontal

This option is a standard horizontal layout that supports dropdown submenus, with a **Submenu layout** choice of a down arrow, plus sign, or nothing. This screenshot shows a horizontal menu with a down arrow for the item with a submenu.

![](/img/menu-module-horizontal-layout.jpg)

You can also add an image to a horizontal layout that appears centered between  the menu items by using the [**Centered + inline logo** settings](#centered--inline-logo).

#### Layout: Vertical

As described above, the vertical menu fills the width of the column, with the submenu icon and search icon right-justified.

The submenu expands to the right and overlays the next column, as shown here:

![](/img/menu-module-vertical-layout-submenu-outside.jpg)

:::tip **Tip**
Vary the submenu color opacity at **Style > Dropdowns > Dropdown background color** to control whether  content displayed underneath the submenu bleeds through or not.
:::

If the vertical menu is in the rightmost column, the submenu displays to the right if there is room between the right edge of the menu and the edge of the browser screen, as shown in this screenshot.

![](/img/menu-module-vertical-layout-submenu-outside-browser-edge.jpg)

If there's no room to expand to the right, it expands to the left. For narrower menus, this means the submenu can cover items in the main menu while it's displayed:

![](/img/menu-module-vertical-layout-submenu-inside-browser-edge.jpg)

The behavior changes when the menu is displayed as an icon. See [the section on responsive behavior](#set-responsive-behavior).

#### Layout: Accordion

The Accordion layout is a vertical layout that expands the menu to display submenu items inline when the toggle icon is clicked. Here's a screenshot showing two submenu items after the down arrow on the **Home** menu link was clicked.

![Menu module, submenu items in an accordion layout](/img/menu-module-accordion-layout-submenu-flush.png)

:::tip
You can see from the screenshot that the submenu is left-aligned with the main menu items, so it's a good idea to change the submenu background color at **Style > Dropdown**.
:::

#### Layout: Expanded

The Expanded layout is similar to the [WordPress Navigation Menu widget](https://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/navigation-menu-widget/). The following screenshot shows an example. Top-level menu and submenu items are displayed in a list and both top-level and submenu items are left-aligned.

![Menu module, expanded layout](/img/menu-module-expanded-layout.png)

:::tip
* You can distinguish submenu items from main menu items with different background colors. The hover color shown in the screenshot comes from the **Style > Dropdowns > Link hover background color**.  The **Style > Dropdowns > Dropdown background color** is ignored.
:::

### Submenu icon

The **Submenu icon** option is available for **Horizontal**, **Vertical**, and **Accordion** layouts.  The choices are as follows:

* Horizontal and vertical layouts: down **Arrows**, **Plus sign**, **None**
* Accordion layout: **Arrows** or **Plus sign**

### Menu name
The value you set for **Menu name** appears in two places:
* The responsive Menu button, if you have chosen that in the [**Responsive Toggle** section](#responsive-toggle).
*  The ARIA label in the HTML output, to help accessibility tools identify the menu.  
For example, if you change the default value **Menu** to **primary menu**, the  HTML included with the Menu module appears like this:

```html
<nav aria-label="primary menu" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/SiteNavigationElement" class="focus">
```

### Centered + inline logo

When **Layout** is set to **Horizontal**, there's a **Centered + inline logo** section with an option to add a logo that appears in the center of the menu items, as in this example.

![Menu module centered inline logo](/img/2-5-features-menu-module-centered-inline-logo.png)

This section has two fields:

* **Logo image**  
Click **Select photo**  to add the image.
 * **Inline logo position**  
When there's an odd number of menu items, the logo cannot appear exactly in the center, so you can choose whether it appears to the left or the right of center. In the following screenshot, **Inline logo position** is set to **Right**, so there are four menu items on the left and three on the right. The [WooCommerce Dynamic Cart](#), which shows information about the cart contents, counts as one menu item, as does the search icon.

![Menu module centered inline logo Right](/img/menu-module-centered-inline-logo-right.png)

:::tip
Horizontal menu items wrap onto a second line as screen size decreases, so be sure to test responsive behavior. The alignment of the wrapped line follows the alignment setting in the **Style > Menu** section.
:::

### Add search

In the **Search** section of the **General** tab, you can show or hide a search icon to the menu, shown in this screenshot.

![Menu module, search icon clicked](/img/menu-module-vertical-expanded-search-form.jpg)

You can replace the default icon with an icon from the [available icon sets](/beaver-builder/management-migration/settings-overview.md/#icons-tab).

In the [**Search menu** section of the **Style** tab](#search-menu-section), you can style both the search icon and the search form that appears when you click the icon.

### Set responsive behavior

The **Responsive** section on the **General** tab controls how the menu layout changes as screen width becomes smaller, with the following settings.

#### Responsive toggle

* **Hamburger icon**  
The hamburger icon is three horizontal lines. If you want a background color, as shown in this screenshot, set it at **Style > Dropdowns > Dropdown background color**.   
![Hamburger icon with background color](/img/menu-module-hamburger-icon.png)
* **Hamburger icon + label**  
This setting includes both the Hamburger icon and a MENU label, with an optional background (set on the **Style** tab).  
![Hamburger icon plus label with background color](/img/menu-module-hamburger-icon-plus-label.png)
* **Menu button**  
This setting is a button with a label.  By default, the menu button label is **Menu** unless you have a custom setting for [**Menu name**](#menu-name).
![Menu button example](/img/menu-module-menu-button.png)
* **None**  
With this setting, the menu items continue to be displayed on smaller devices rather than changing to a Hamburger icon or Menu button.  
For a menu whose **Layout** setting is **Horizontal**, another setting appears immediately underneath the **None** setting, called **Stacked layout**. As shown in the following screenshot, if this setting **No**, the menu remains horizontal and wraps on small devices. If  **Yes**, then on smaller devices the menu items are displayed in an Accordion (vertical) list.  
![Menu module, resonsive toggle non, stacking option](/img/menu-module-responsive-section.png)
For all other menu layouts, the **None** setting displays an [Accordion layout](#layout-accordion).   
With the **None** setting, you won't see the settings for **Responsive style** and **Responsive breakpoint** described in the following two sections.  

#### Responsive style

This setting has the following  options for menu expansion when the responsive icon or button is clicked.

* **Inline**  
The expanded menu falls below the hamburger. This works for centered menus but doesn’t work if, for example, you have a hamburger in a small column on the right. The menu gets squished.
* **Below row**  
This option removes the menu in the markup and puts it below the column that the menu is in. This means that expanded menus in small columns still appear inline but don’t get squished.
* **Overlay**  
See [this Beaver Builder Theme article](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/headers-nav-menus/choose-how-menus-open-responsively.md/#responsive-menu-dropdown) for an example.
* **Flyout overlay**  
See [this Beaver Builder Theme article](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/headers-nav-menus/choose-how-menus-open-responsively.md/##flyout-overlay) for an example.
* **Flyout push**  
See [this Beaver Builder Theme article](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/headers-nav-menus/choose-how-menus-open-responsively.md/#flyout-push) for an example.
* **Flyout push with opacity**  
See [this Beaver Builder Theme article](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/headers-nav-menus/choose-how-menus-open-responsively.md/#flyout-push-with-opacity) for an example.

#### Responsive breakpoint

By default, the responsive menu appears on small devices only, but you can change the behavior to medium and small devices, or all devices.

## WooCommerce tab

If the WooCommerce plugin is installed, there's a **WooCommerce** tab with settings for the WooCommerce dynamic cart, which includes quantity or pricing information. The following screenshot shows the difference between the **Cart** menu item added to the WordPress menu at **Appearance > Menus** versus the dynamic cart added with the Menu module:

![Menu module WooCommerce tab](/img/menu-module-woocommerce-tab.png)

This tab has the following settings.

* **Menu cart**  
If you choose **Hide**, the word **Cart** appears instead of the dynamic cart. If for some reason you prefer to show a cart icon that doesn't include the dynamic information about the cart, here's an article that shows [how to replace the word `Cart` with an icon](/beaver-builder/styles/icons/add-an-icon-to-a-menu-item.md).
* **Cart icon**  
You can replace the default Cart icon with another icon from your [icon library](/beaver-builder/management-migration/settings-overview.md/#icons-tab).
* **Show on checkout**  
This setting determines whether the dynamic cart icon appears in the menu on the Checkout page.
* **Display type**  
This setting lets you choose which dynamic information appears with the icon: number of items in the cart, total purchased, or both.

You can style the options you choose in the **WooCommerce dynamic cart** section of the **Style** tab.

## Style tab

The **Style** tab has the following options.

### Menu section

This section has two settings:

* **Menu alignment**  
Left, center, or right alignment of main menu items.
* **Menu background color**

### Links section

* **Link color**  
Set the color of the menu items when they're not active.
* **Link hover color**  
Set the color of the menu items that are either active (displaying that page), on hover with a mouse, or immediately after being tapped.
* **Link hover background color**
You can optionally set a background color for the menu items that are either active (displaying that page), on hover with a mouse, or immediately after being tapped.

:::info
If you're using the Beaver Builder Theme, the default menu link colors appear in the color you defined in **Appearance > Customize > General > Accent Color**, and you can customize this color.
:::

* **Link padding**  
The number of pixels or ems of padding between menu item text and the menu item boundary.
* **Link typography**  
See the article about typography settings [Typography section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md) to style your menu text.

:::note **Notes:**
If you are using the Beaver Builder Theme, the default font family is what you defined for content in **Customize > General > Text**.
:::

### Separators section

Set **Show separators** to **Yes** to display horizontal lines between menu items.

### Dropdowns section

These settings control submenu items in the following categories

#### Dropdown color settings

This screenshot shows an example of the dropdown color settings listed below.

![Style tab Dropdowns section color settings](/img/menu-module-style-dropdowns-section.png)

* **Link color**
* **Link hover color**
* **Link hover background color**
* **Dropdown background color**
* **Dropdown shadow**  
Shows a drop shadow on the submenu items.

#### Dropdown padding

* **Dropdown padding**  
Adds padding between the dropdown boundary box border and the block of menu item text. Here's an example of **Dropdown padding** set to 20px, **Dropdown link padding** set to 0px:  
![Dropdown padding 20, dropdown link padding 0](/img/menu-module-dropdown-padding-set.png)
* **Dropdown link padding**
Adds padding around the text for each dropdown menu item. Here's an example of **Dropdown padding** set to 0px, **Dropdown link padding** set to 20px. Because the dropdown link padding is set both on top and bottom, the distance between the two submenu items increases to 40px:  
![Dropdown padding 0, dropdown link padding 20](/img/menu-module-dropdown-link-padding-set.png)

#### Dropdown border

You can add a border, round the corners, and add a shadow around the dropdown submenus.  See the article about [border settings](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/borders.md).

#### Dropdown typography

See the article about typography settings [Typography section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md) to style your submenu text.

### Responsive dropdowns

You can style the following responsive dropdown settings differently from the dropdown settings for larger devices:

* Link color
* Link hover color
* Link hover background color
* Dropdown background color

### Responsive Toggle section

If **General > Responsive toggle** is set to anything other than **None**, there's also a **Responsive toggle** section on the **Style** tab where you can set the size of the Responsive toggle plus submenu dropdown background colors, text colors, and borders, as shown in this screenshot.

![Menu module responsive toggle on Style tab](/img/menu-module-style-tab-responsive-toggle.png)

### Search Menu section

If **General > Search menu** is set to **Show**, there's a **Search menu** section on the **Style** tab where you can style not only the search icon but also the search form, which appears when you click the search icon. This section has the following settings.

* **Icon size**
* **Icon color**
* **Icon hover color**
* **Form width**
* **Form background color**
* **Form background hover color**
* **Form border**  
See the article about [border settings](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/borders.md).
* **Form border hover**
* **Form padding**

### WooCommerce Menu Cart style settings

If you have WooCommerce installed and the **Menu Cart** option set to **Show** on the WooCommerce tab, then the **Style** tab has a **WooCommerce menu cart** section with the following settings.

* **Background color**
* **Hover background color**
* **Color**  
This setting changes the color of both the icon and any other options you have set to display.
* **Hover color**
* **Typography**  
See the article about typography settings [Typography section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md).

## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
