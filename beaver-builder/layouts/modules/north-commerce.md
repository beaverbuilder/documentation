The North Commerce module is a Beaver Builder module that allows you to display North Commerce products on your website. The module becomes available in the Beaver Builder UI when you have the North Commerce plugin installed.

The North Commerce module utilizes North Commerce shortcodes to showcase various layouts, offering a convenient and straightforward method to present your North Commerce products on your website. This eliminates the need to manually write any shortcodes.

See the [North Commerce documentation](https://docs.northcommerce.com/north-commerce/shortcodes/product-collections) for more information on shortcodes and how to use them.
