Despite our best efforts, Assistant may not be compatible with everything. Since the development of themes and plugins changes rapidly, if you want to try the listed products anyway, please let us know if they are compatible with Assistant.

## Themes

The Assistant plugin has been developed to work with almost any theme and allows you to save your themeâ€™s customizer settings.

### Astra

Astra theme and Astra child theme settings are coded in such a way that the Assistant plugin is not able to apply them.

### Genesis Framework

Genesis Framework and Genesis child theme settings are coded in such a way that the Assistant plugin is not able to apply them.
