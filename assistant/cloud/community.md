## What is the Assistant Community?

The Assistant Community is a marketplace where WordPress developers can acquire free and premium page builder templates, images and .svg graphics. Designers can become community marketplace [sellers](account-settings/seller.md) to monetize their design work.

## Explore the Community

You may browse through creative assets by type (Everything, Templates, Images, and Vectors) to filter the listings in accordance with the type you choose.

Search and sort the results by popularity, recent, favourites, built width (Anything, Beaver Builder, WordPress Block Editor, Divi, and Elementor), and price. Using the View As option, you can choose between a grid or list layout of libraries and assets.

You can also explore the community from the Assistant plugin's [Community app](../plugin/apps/community.md).
