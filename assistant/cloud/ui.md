The Assistant Pro interface is designed to help you manage your libraries and assets quickly and intuitively. It’s made up of three main areas: the Top Bar, the Sidebar, and the main content area.

## Top Bar

The Top Bar sits at the top of the app and provides quick access to key sections. Navigation is centered and includes:

- Libraries, manage and organize all your library assets.
- Showcase, explore featured examples and inspiration.
- Community, connect with other Assistant users.
- Account, manage your account details and subscription.

On the right side of the Top Bar, you’ll find:

- Upgrade button (Free accounts only), upgrade to Pro at any time to unlock additional features.
- Gift icon, opens the notifications modal, where you’ll find announcements and updates about new features in Assistant and Assistant Pro.

## Sidebar

On the left-hand side of the interface is the Assistant Sidebar. This is where you manage your libraries.

Here you’ll see:

- A list of all libraries you’ve created.
- An option to create additional libraries.

Clicking on any library name loads its contents in the main panel, where you can view, import, delete, and manage all items within that library.

At the bottom of the Sidebar, Team account users will also see the option to Create a Team, allowing you to collaborate and share libraries with others.

## Main Content Area

When you select a library from the Sidebar, its items appear in the main content area. From here, you can:
	
- View all assets in the selected library.
- Import items to your library.
- Manage content, media, colors, code, and settings.
