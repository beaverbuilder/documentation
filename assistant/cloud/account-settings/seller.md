A Seller Account allows you to utilize the Assistant Pro Community to monetize your design work.

:::caution
You will need to use your personal account if you wish to sell libraries. **[Team accounts](../teams.md) are not currently supported**.
:::

## Access the Seller Account menu

In order to access the Seller Account menu, you need either a **Personal** or **Team** plan. Despite being part of the Assistant Community, free accounts do not have access to Seller Accounts or the ability to monetize their design work.

1. Log into your [Assistant account](https://app.assistant.pro/login).

2. Navigate to the **Account tab**.

3. If you have a **Personal** or **Team** plan, you will have access to the Seller Account menu.

  Alternatively, if you already have a [Existing Stripe account](#existing-stripe-accounts), you can connect it to your Assistant account. Stripe will then create a new account under your main account for your Assistant Pro activity.
