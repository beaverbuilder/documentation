This article explains what a library is and what the differences between public and private libraries are.

## What is a Library?

Libraries are collections of page builder templates and creative assets, such as images, code, and colors. You can use libraries to organize content, and import them into any WordPress website with a single click.

## Public vs Private Libraries

If you upgrade to a Personal or Team account, you will have the option to make the Library **"Private"**.

* Public Libraries can be accessed by anyone and the creative assets can be imported on their websites using the Assistant plugin.
* Private Libraries can only be accessed by users who have been invited.

## Downgrade or Cancel my Premium Subscription?

If you downgrade or cancel your premium subscription, the system will provide you the option to make your Private Library public, or it will remain Private where you can still view it.
