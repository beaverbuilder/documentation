You can create a library [through the Assistant plugin](../../plugin/apps/libraries.md/#create-a-library) or directly in the Assistant Pro Cloud UI.  Libraries are shared the same regardless of how they are created.

To create a new library directly in Assistant Pro Cloud:

1. Click the **Libraries** menu.
2. In the sidebar, enter a library name.
3. Click the **Enter** button or hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> / <kbd>Return</kbd> on your keyboard.

:::info

Please note that free users can create one library. Existing free accounts will retain access to any libraries they currently have, but if they have more than one, they wonâ€™t be able to create additional libraries. To access unlimited libraries, upgrading to a Personal or Team plan is required. Premium users can also make their libraries private by clicking the lock icon or adjusting the privacy settings within the library.
