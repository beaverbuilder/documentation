You can create a library [through the Assistant plugin](../../plugin/apps/libraries.md/#create-a-library) or directly in the Assistant Pro Cloud UI.  Libraries are shared the same regardless of how they are created.

To create a new library directly in Assistant Pro Cloud:

1. Click the **Libraries** menu.
2. In the sidebar, enter a library name.
3. Click the **Enter** button or hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> / <kbd>Return</kbd> on your keyboard.

:::note
Premium users can also make the library private by clicking the lock icon (or you can make libraries private under library settings).
