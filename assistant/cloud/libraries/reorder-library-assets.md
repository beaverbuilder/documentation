Both in the plugin and on the web, you can re-order library assets in a library.  For each library asset type, you can click on an item and drag it to the order you would like it to appear.

:::tip This is useful for libraries that are displayed in the Community App so an owner can control what assets appear in the library preview to potential users/purchasers.
