In addition to Beaver Builder, the Assistant Pro Cloud platform allows you to add content from other mainstream page builders including Divi, Elementor, and Visual Composer.

To add third-party page builder content, simply add posts and pages with the third-party page builder layouts to your libraries using the [Content](../../plugin/apps/content.md) or 
[Libraries](../../plugin/apps/libraries.md) apps.

## Content app

In the case of supported page builders like Divi, Elementor, and Visual Composer, you can also add templates. Depending on the page builder you are using, the [Content app](../../plugin/apps/content.md) items will change depending on how your page builder organizes content.
