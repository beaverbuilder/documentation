The Assistant plugin adds options to your WordPress User Profile, allowing you to toggle the display of the Assistant button and show the Assistant UI in the WordPress Admin Dashboard.

## Access Assistant User Settings

To access the Assistant User Settings, navigate to **Users > Your Profile** in the WordPress Admin Dashboard. Scroll down to the **Assistant** section, as shown in the screenshot below.

## Toggle Button

The Toggle Button option allows you to switch between "Button" (Default) and "Admin Bar Item" choices. When you choose "Admin Bar Item," the Assistant Button is removed, which can be advantageous if you find it distracting.

To launch Assistant with the "Admin Bar Item" selected, simply click the Assistant link located in the WordPress Admin Bar (the black bar at the top of your website when logged into WordPress).
