The Assistant plugin adds a sidebar to the frontend pages of your WordPress site. The sidebar lets you easily perform tasks that you would normally need to access from the backend of your site. 

To toggle the sidebar on, click the floating pencil icon in the upper right corner of your siteâ€™s frontend pages:

<video autoPlay loop>
<source src="/video/assistant/apps--apps-overview.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
<source src="/video/assistant/apps--apps-overview.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

## Change Button Location

By default, the Assistant Button is located in the top right-hand corner of your screen. However, if this initial position is not suitable for you, you can effortlessly relocate it to the top left, bottom right, or bottom left corners. This feature grants you the ability to select a more suitable and appropriate location for the Assistant Button.

To adjust the position of the button, simply hover your mouse cursor over it, click and hold, then drag the button to your desired corner. Once you release the button, it will automatically snap into place. You don't need to be overly precise with your positioning; as long as you drag the button close to your preferred corner and release it, it will align accordingly.
