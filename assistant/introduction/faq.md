Frequently asked questions for the Assistant plugin & cloud.

## Can I try Assistant Pro before I buy it?

Yes, we ask that you set up a free account first, take it for a spin... and if you would like to upgrade to our premium features you can easily do so within the dashboard.

## Can I upgrade my membership after signing up?

Absolutely! You can easily change your subscription status within the Billing Information tab under Account.

## What is the difference between monthly and annual billing?

The two available billing periods differ in regards to when the payment method is charged and in the total price:

* The monthly billing plan charges your payment method each month on the date when the plan was started.
* The annual billing plan charges once a year on the date when the plan was started and offers a 20% discount.

## Will my subscription renew automatically?

Yes, your Assistant Pro subscription will automatically renew after one month or year depending on your subscription, although you can easily cancel auto-renewal on your account page within the Billing Information tab under Account. An active premium subscription is required to access some Assistant Pro features and premium support.

## What happens if I don't renew my subscription? Will I lose my libraries?

When an active Assistant Pro Premium subscription is canceled or not renewed, you'll have the option to make private libraries public libraries, or, leave them private, but in read-only mode. You may delete and/or transfer private libraries via settings. If you would like to use private libraries, you must have an active Assistant Pro Premium subscription.

## How many user accounts are included with my subscription?

The number of user accounts depends on your subscription (Free, Personal, or Team). The Free and Personal accounts each offer one user account, and Team offers three user accounts. You can add additional users at $5 per month each.

## What payment methods do you accept and what is your refund policy?

We accept payment via Stripe (Visa, MasterCard, JCB, Discover, Dinerâ€™s Club, and American Express card). Although we don't think you'll ever want a refund, we will gladly refund your purchase if it's requested within 14 days.
