To add custom shortcodes, HTML, or just text to your [Beaver Builder Theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/wordpress-framework-theme/) nav menus, we recommend using the [Shortcodes in Menus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-in-menus/) plugin.

Adding extra content is particularly useful for the Nav Vertical Left or Nav Vertical Right header layouts, which can have a fairly large open area below the menu.
