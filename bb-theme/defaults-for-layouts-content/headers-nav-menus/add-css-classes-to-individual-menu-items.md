It's easy to add custom CSS classes and rules to individual menu items.

There's a **CSS classes** field in WordPress that's disabled by default, but once you display it, you can add custom classes to any menu item.

**To display the CSS classes field:**

  1. From the WordPress admin panel, go to **Appearance > Menus**.
  2. Click **Screen options** in the upper right corner and in the section **Show advanced menu properties**, select the **CSS classes** checkbox.
  If you expand a single menu item, you'll see a **CSS classes** field.

  After you enable the CSS classes screen option, you'll also see that field in **Customize > Menus**:

  3. Add one or more custom classes to that field for any particular menu item, then style it as you like with CSS rules. For an example, see the article about [how to turn a menu item into a button](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/headers-nav-menus/add-buttons-to-your-navigation-menu.md).
