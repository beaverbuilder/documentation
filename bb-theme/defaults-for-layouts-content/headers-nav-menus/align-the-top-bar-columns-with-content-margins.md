If you have two columns on your top bar and want to match them with your content margins, you need to alter settings in the Beaver Builder Theme, the Beaver Builder plugin's **Global Settings**, or both.

  * The width of the two top bar columns is set in **Customize > General > Layout > Content width**.
  * The width of your content (the area between the header and the footer) is set as **Max  width** in the **Rows** section of the Beaver Builder plugin's **Global Settings**.

For more information about the relation between these two settings, see [the **Width** setting on the **General > Layout** tab](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md/#width) and the overview of [full-width and boxed layouts](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/full-width-boxed/overview-of-full-width-and-boxed-pages-and-rows.md/#beaver-builder-sets-the-row-and-content-width-in-layouts).
