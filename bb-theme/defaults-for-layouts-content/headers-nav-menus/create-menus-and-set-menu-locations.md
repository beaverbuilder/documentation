There are two parts to menu configuration: you configure what will appear in a menu, and you associate that menu with the location in which it will appear.

[Configure both](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/menus.md) in **Customize > Menus**.

See also [this article for an explanation of where menu colors come from](/bb-theme/defaults-for-styles/colors/where-do-menu-colors-come-from.md).
