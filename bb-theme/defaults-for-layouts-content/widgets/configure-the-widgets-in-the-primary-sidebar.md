If you [enable the Beaver Builder Theme's sidebar](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/content.md/#blog-layout) to appear on your blog or static pages, the theme's Primary sidebar will be displayed.

You can [use any widgets you like](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/widgets.md) in the Primary sidebar. You can access the Widgets area in either of two ways:

  * Go to **Customize > Widgets** in the Beaver Builder Theme.
  * Go to **Appearance > Widgets** in the WordPress admin panel.

If you want more control over displaying particular widgets on particular posts of pages, you can use a plugin or custom code.
