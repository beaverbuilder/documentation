In the Beaver Builder Theme, you can enable a footer area with widgets above the main footer bar. You can configure both layout and style of these footer widgets, including whether the footer widget appears only on the home page or on every page of your website.

:::tip **Tip**
In the Beaver Builder Theme, non-blog-related widgets can only appear in the footer widgets area. If you want WordPress widgets in other locations, you can insert them anywhere in your layout in the Beaver Builder editor.
:::

You can [set options for footer widgets](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/footer.md) in **Customize > Footer > Footer Widget Layout** and **Customize > Footer > Footer Widget Style**.

:::info
If you enable footer widgets, [set up the widget content](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/widgets.md) in **Customize > Widgets**.
