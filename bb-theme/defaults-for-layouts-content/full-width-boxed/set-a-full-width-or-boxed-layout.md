Setting your layout to stretch from edge to edge across the page or appear inside a boxed boundary within the browser window is done in **General > Layouts**. See the [overview of full-width and boxed pages and rows](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/full-width-boxed/overview-of-full-width-and-boxed-pages-and-rows.md).
