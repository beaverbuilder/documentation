In the Beaver Builder Theme, you can add custom code that will be inserted on every page in your site. You can control whether your code appears in the `<head>` tag, immediately after the opening `<body>` tag, or immediately before the close `</body>` tag. See the article on [adding code in the Customizer](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/code.md).
