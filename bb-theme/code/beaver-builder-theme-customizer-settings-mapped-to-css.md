* The top bar background and text colors can be set at **Customize > Header > Top bar style**, which translates to the CSS class `.fl-page-bar`.
* The header background and text colors can be set at **Customize > Header > Header style**, which translates to the CSS class `.fl-page-header`.
* If you choose a Preset layout whose nav bar is a different color from the header, you can customize the nav bar at **Customize > Header > Nav style**, or you can write a CSS rule for the class `.fl-page-nav-wrap`.
* The background for the content area is set at **Customize > Content > Content background** and translates to the CSS class `.fl-page-content`.
* The footer widget background and text colors can be set at **Customize > Footer > Footer widgets style**, which translates to the CSS class `.fl-page-footer-widgets`.
* The footer background and text colors can be set at **Customize > Footer > Footer style**, which translates to `.fl-page-footer`.
* The page background color, which displayed outside the box, is set at **Customize > General > Background**. This background color is set on the `<body>` tag.
