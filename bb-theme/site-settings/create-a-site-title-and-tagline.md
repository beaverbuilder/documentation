In the Beaver Builder Theme, if you want text to appear in the header layout instead of a logo, you set it in **Customize > Header > Header logo** and you can enter the text you like.

No matter whether you use text or a logo in the header, you should add a site title and tagline in **Customize > Settings > Site identity**. This information is important because it appears in search results. The **Site title** field is good for a business or blog name, while the tagline is good for entering information such as location and a description of your site using keywords that will facilitate search.

:::tip **Tip**
Instead of entering the site title and tagline in Customizer, you can go to **Settings > General** in the WordPress admin panel and enter it there.
