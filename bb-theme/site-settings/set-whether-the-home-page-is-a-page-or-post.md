You must tell WordPress whether the front page of your website is a blog archive or a static page, or whether you have a blog on another page on your site.

  1. Go to either **Appearance > Customize > Settings > Static front page** (BB Theme) or **Settings > Reading > Front page displays**.
  2. Do one of the following:
    1. If your home page is a blog archive (a summary that points to individual blog pages), and your blog doesn't use Beaver Builder for post content layouts, then choose **Your latest posts**.
    2. If your home page is not a blog, or you have used Beaver Builder to create a post archive on your home page, choose **A static page**, and choose the name of your front page.
  3. If you have a blog somewhere on your site besides the home page, whether or not you have set it up in Beaver Builder, choose the name of the page on which your blog archive appears.

For more information about static front pages, see the [WordPress codex](https://wordpress.org/support/article/creating-a-static-front-page/).
