The default color in the Customizer color picker is always based on the **Default** preset.

For example, suppose you choose the **Default Dark** preset, which has an off-black header background:

![](/img/preset-troubleshooting-resetting-color-to-default-doesnt-work-8ae76bbd.png)

You then change the header background color in **Customize > Header > Header Style**:

![](/img/preset-troubleshooting-resetting-color-to-default-doesnt-work-e22ef4a8.png)

Wow, that wasn't what you were going for, so you click the **Default** button next to the color picker. Now the header background color is white:

![](/img/preset-troubleshooting-resetting-color-to-default-doesnt-work-8294ee27.png)

That's because white is the default header background color of the **Default** preset.

To return to the color of the preset you chose, look up the color hex value in the [Customizer: Presets](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/presets.md) article and enter that instead.
