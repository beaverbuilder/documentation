The [jQuery Modal plugin](https://jquerymodal.com) conflicts with Bootstrap, which is the framework on which Beaver Builder Theme is built.

The incompatibility is documented on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal). The author states "If you want to use **jQuery Modal** with Bootstrap, the simplest solution is to manually modify the name of this plugin."
