description: Describes the Beaver Builder Theme settings available on the Header tab in the Customizer
---

The [Beaver Builder Theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/wordpress-framework-theme/) supports several different header styles with a variety of styling options.

The header area includes:

  * An optional top bar
  * The main header area, which contains text or a logo
  * A navigation menu, which in some header layouts is part of the main header area and in others (Nav Bottom and Nav Centered) is styled as a separate menu bar below the header, as shown in the following screenshot.

See the header descriptions below and the article on [where menu colors come from](/bb-theme/defaults-for-styles/colors/where-do-menu-colors-come-from.md)  for more information about the color sources of header layout types.

:::tip **Troubleshooting tip**
[Beaver Themer](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/) Header-type layouts override these Customizer settings on the pages to which they apply. If you have the Beaver Themer plugin installed and your Customizer settings don't seem to be working, check to see if there is a Themer [Header layout](/beaver-themer/layout-types-modules/header-layout-type/themer-header-layout-type.md) applied to that page.
:::

## Top bar layout

You can optionally enable a top bar strip above your header with up to two columns of content. Itâ€™s a great place for quick messages or social icons.

If you select **Text** for either column, you can enter HTML in the content areas, such as links to email addresses, heading tags, or even a small image.

If you select **Social icons**, [configure the icons](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md/#social-links) at **Customize > General > Social links**.

If you enable just one column, the content is centered. If you enable two columns, the left column is left-justified and the right column is right-justified at larger screen sizes. As the screen is sized smaller, the two columns become stacked and centered.

The maximum width of the content is controlled by the [Content width setting](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md/#content-width) in **Customize > General > Layout**.

## Top bar style

You can set the following styles in the top bar:

  * A background color or image in the top bar, with all the usual settings for positioning and sizing the background image.
  * Top bar text font color, link color, and hover color.

## Header layout

Header layout settings apply to both the main header and menu areas, not the top bar. The settings on this tab depend on the choice you make in the **Layout** field. We'll cover the **Layout** options one by one.

### None

The header and menu are not displayed when the page first loads. The top bar remains visible if it is enabled. If you set the **Fixed header** field to **Fade in**, a header with the site title on the left and menu on the right will appear when you start scrolling the page on large screens only. On medium and small screens, the header remains hidden.

See [this article](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/headers-nav-menus/hide-the-header-nav-menu.md) for the CSS code to display the header but hide the nav menu.

### Nav bottom

Menu items appear below the header. The site title (or header logo) and the menu are left-aligned.

Here's the default Nav Bottom layout on medium devices, with the same settings.

![](/img/customizer-settings-the-header-tab-f17b82f9.png)

And here's the default mobile layout with the same settings. Either the Menu button or the hamburger icon will appear, depending on your setting in **Customize > Header > Nav layout > Responsive nav toggle**.

* **Content layout**  
  If enabled, you can add text, social icons, or both in a second column to the right of the header logo. If you select **Social icons**, [configure the icons](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md/#social-links) at **Customize > General > Social links**.

#### Nav layout and style

The Nav area can be configured separately on the [**Nav layout**](#nav-layout) and [**Nav Style**](#nav-style) tabs. See those sections for details.

#### Device view

### Nav vertical left, Nav vertical right

Header and menu items appear in a vertical bar along the left or right side of the page in the header background color, with a fixed layout (doesn't scroll with the content to the right). You can customize settings for the width and padding of the left or right bar.

![](/img/customizer-settings-the-header-tab-ceb06eb7.jpg)

:::tip **Tip**
The header logo is sized according to the amount of space in the vertical bar. If the logo appears too small, decrease the **Padding** setting first, then try increasing the **Vertical nav width** setting.
:::

As screen width is sized smaller, menu items appear centered below the header, then as the width is reduced even more, menu items are replaced by the word MENU or a hamburger icon, depending on which Nav layout option you choose.

## Header style

This category has several settings that relate to two aspects of the header logo area:

* Background  
  You can set a background color or image, with associated style settings.
* Text color  
  You can set text color, link color, and hover color. These color settings apply to the two parts of the header logo area that can contain text: the header logo if you choose text instead of an image; and the **Content layout** area in the **Nav bottom** layout. Note that the hover color also styles the current page item in the menu.

## Header logo

Choose **Text** or **Image** as the logo type.

For text as the logo type, you can choose font family, font weight, and font size, logo text color and text hover color. Horizontal alignment is controlled by the header layout type.

For image logos, you can add both a standard and high-DPI (retina) version. You can set a different header logo image for mobile devices in the **Mobile header logo** field. By default, the max-width breakpoint for mobile devices is 768px.

You can also upload a different standard and Retina logo for **Fade In** header layouts. For example, you might want to upload a smaller or shorter version of the logo that will fit in the narrow upper band. After you've uploaded the logo, make sure you've selected the **Fade In** type of fixed header in **Customize > Header > Header layout**.

## Nav layout

On the **Nav layout** tab, you can control the following aspects of the nav menu in the header.

* **Nav item spacing**  
  Set the number of pixels between menu items.
* **Nav search icon**  
  Choose whether or not to display a WordPress search icon. By default, WordPress searches only Post  titles and Post content.
* **Responsive nav toggle**  
  Choose the **Menu button** or [**Hamburger icon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button) to appear when the screen width goes below the **Responsive nav breakpoint**  
For Menu button and Hamburger icon colors, see this article about [where menu colors come from](/bb-theme/defaults-for-styles/colors/where-do-menu-colors-come-from.md).
* Menu button text  
  If you choose the MENU button for the **Responsive nav toggle**, you can enter a custom label instead of MENU.
* **Responsive nav breakpoint**  
Choose the breakpoint at which to display the Hamburger icon or Menu button. The choices are:
  * Always (displayed on every device size)  
  * Medium & small devices only  
  * (Default): Small devices only  
**Note**
The default breakpoints are 992px for medium screens and 768px for small screens. You can [change these breakpoints on the **General** tab](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md#theme-medium-breakpoint-and-mobile-breakpoint).
* **Hamburger icon position**  
If you chose to display a Hamburger icon, then you can change the vertical position where it appears. The default setting is `0` and increasing the value moves the icon down. You can set the [Responsive preview](/bb-theme/getting-started/responsive-previews.md) to mobile to view where it will appear.
* **Responsive nav layout**  
You can choose one of the animated flyout settings or the standard menu dropdown to appear when you click the Hamburger icon or Menu button. For more information about each choice, see [the article about flyout animations](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/headers-nav-menus/choose-how-menus-open-responsively.md).
* **Responsive nav layout position** (Appears only when **Responsive nav layout** is set to a flyout choice.)  
  Choose whether the flyout menu appears to the left or right.
* **Responsive submenu toggle**  
  This setting applies to the case in which you have a submenu of a submenu â€“ in other words, multiple levels of submenus. When the setting is **Disabled**, clicking a top-level menu item opens all descendants with one click when the Hamburger icon or Menu button is in use.  
  ![](/img/customizer-settings-the-header-tab-b522c887.gif)  
  When the setting is **Enabled**, you must click each level to display the next level of submenu.  
  ![](/img/customizer-settings-the-header-tab-09144492.gif)
* **Responsive collapse**  
  Choose **No** to allow more than one submenu to be open at the same time  when the Hamburger icon or Menu button is in use. Choose **Yes** to automatically hide a submenu when another submenu is opened.

## Nav style

The **Nav style** tab has the following settings.

#### Submenu indicator

You can enable a Font Awesome down arrow icon to main menu items that have submenus, as in this screenshot.

![](/img/customizer-settings-the-header-tab-8963625b.png)

#### Nav background and text color

When the header layout puts the menu below the header logo area ( **Nav Centered** or **Nav Bottom** ), you can select a background color or image for the menu bar plus nav text color for large screens.  For medium and small screens, see this article about [where menu colors come from](/bb-theme/defaults-for-styles/colors/where-do-menu-colors-come-from.md).

#### Font family, weight, format, size

You can set the font family, weight, format, and size specifically for the navigation menu.
