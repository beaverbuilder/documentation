You can add HTML, CSS or JavaScript code into various locations within the HTML page that the Beaver Builder Theme generates.

##  Javascript code

Javascript entered in this area will be rendered within `<script>` tags right before the closing `<head>` tag on every page, so don't include the `<script>` tags when you paste in code here.

## Head code

HTML, CSS, or Javascript entered in this area will be rendered in the `<head>` tag on every page. If you insert JavaScript into this section, include the `<script>` tags. This is the place to paste [Google Analytics code](/bb-theme/code/insert-google-analytics-code.md). 

##  Header code

HTML, CSS, or Javascript entered in this area will be rendered directly after the opening `<body>` tag on every page.

##  Footer code

HTML, CSS, or Javascript entered in this area will be rendered directly before the closing `</body>` tag on every page.
