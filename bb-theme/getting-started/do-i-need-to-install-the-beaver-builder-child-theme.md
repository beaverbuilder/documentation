Well you're not forced to use it, but here's why it's always a good idea to install a child theme.

Unlike some themes where there are various flashy child themes built on top of a framework theme, the Beaver Builder child theme that's available for download on your [My Account page](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) is blank.

Why blank, and if so, why do you need it?

So that any code customizations you make don't get overwritten by updated versions of the parent theme.

:::tip **Tip**
Even if you think you're not going to add any code customizations (CSS, PHP, JavaScript) to your website, it's a best practice to install the child theme anyway. You never need to update it, and if you ever do want to add some code, it's going to be a lot easier than trying to install the child theme after you already have a working website. The Beaver Builder Knowledge Base has lots of code examples that you can just copy and paste into your child theme.

See [this WordPress Codex article](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) for more information about why to use child themes. WordPress has instructions for creating a blank child theme, but we've made it easy by creating one for you to download and install.
