---

The [Beaver Builder Theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/wordpress-framework-theme/) isn't required for the [Beaver Builder Plugin](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com) but it's a great framework theme with clean code and lots of options that are set in the WordPress Customizer.

:::tip
You can check whether your Beaver Builder version includes the theme on the [Beaver Builder pricing page](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/pricing/). If you want to add the Theme, it's easy to [upgrade to a different premium version](/beaver-builder/account/license/upgrade.md).
:::

You can choose between the video installation instructions here or written instructions below. Installing the Beaver Builder child theme is optional but [we strongly encourage it](/bb-theme/getting-started/install-the-bb-theme-and-child-theme.md#should-i-use-the-beaver-builder-child-theme).

## Should I use the Beaver Builder child theme?

Technically no, but we strongly advise that you install the Beaver Builder child theme. [Here's the long answer](/bb-theme/getting-started/do-i-need-to-install-the-beaver-builder-child-theme.md), which explains what the Beaver Builder child theme is and why you should install it.

You can create your own child theme, but we've made it easy by giving you a child theme to download and install.

:::info
The child theme does not need to be updated when you update the Beaver Builder Theme parent.
:::

## System requirements

See the [system requirements](/beaver-builder/getting-started/system-requirements.md) for viewing and building with the Beaver Builder plugin and theme.

## Download the Beaver Builder Theme and child theme

Download the Beaver Builder Theme and child theme zip files from the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page.

:::info
If you're a Mac/Safari user and the download shows up as a folder instead of a zip file, you won't be able to install, because WordPress requires uploading a zip file. See [how to download a zip file on Safari](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/common-issues/i-cant-upload-the-installer-zip-file-because-it-is-unzipped-when-i-download.md).
:::

## Install the theme and child theme

  1. From the Admin panel in your WordPress installation, go to **Appearance > Themes**.
  2. At the top of the content area, click **Add New** and then **Upload Theme**.
  3. Upload the Beaver Builder Theme zip file, but don't activate it.
  4. Repeat this procedure to upload the child theme zip file.
  5. Activate the child theme.

:::tip **Tip**
If you install your child theme after you've already set up Customizer settings in the parent theme, [export your Customizer settings](/bb-theme/management-migration/export-or-import-customizer-settings.md) from the parent theme and import them into the child theme.
:::

## Customize your design

All Beaver Builder Theme customization is done through the WordPress Customizer, which you can access by choosing **Appearance > Customize** on the WordPress Admin Panel. Here are a few of the things you can customize with the Beaver Builder Theme:

  * Color scheme
  * Default fonts for headings and text
  * Site header and footer layout and content
  * Menus and widgets
  * Custom global code for your site

See all the theme topics for lots of help and tips.

:::tip **Tip**
Don't forget to click **Save** when you are done setting up your Customizer settings.
