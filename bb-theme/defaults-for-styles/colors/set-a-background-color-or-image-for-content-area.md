You can set a background color or image for the entire content area -- the area between the header and footer. For images, you have the typical choice of properties: whether the image repeats, how it is sized for the screen, and whether it scrolls with the content or stays fixed in place.

The [background color or image for the content area](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/content.md/#content-background) is set in **Customize > Content > Content Background**.

:::tip **Tips**
* If you only want to fill part of the content area with a background color or image, set the color or image on rows or columns in the Beaver Builder editor.
* You can also [set a background color for the entire browser window](/bb-theme/defaults-for-styles/colors/set-a-background-color-or-image-for-the-browser-window.md).
