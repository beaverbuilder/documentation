Google fonts are built into a list of default fonts that you can choose from for your theme's headings and text in your header, footer, and content areas.

The [default font settings for headings](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md/#headings) are at **Customize > General > Headings**. The [default font settings for text](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md/#text) are at **Customize > General > Text**.
