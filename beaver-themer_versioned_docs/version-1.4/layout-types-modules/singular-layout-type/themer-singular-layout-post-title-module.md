The Post Title module is in the **Post modules** category, which appears on when you're editing a Singular-type themer layout in Themer.

The Post Title module displays the title of the post or page â€“ just like you'd imagine.

## Under the hood

The Post Title module is a "shortcut" module. It's actually a Heading module with a field connection set to **Post title** in the **Heading** field. When you open this module for editing, you'll have the regular Heading module settings, such as:

  * Adding an optional link
  * Style settings for text, including font family
  * Special settings for mobile devices
  * The usual **Advanced** tab settings
