The Archive Title module is in the **Archive modules** category in Themer, which appears on when you're editing an Archive-type themer layout.

The Archive Title module displays the title of the archive. If it's an index (general archive), it displays the title *Posts*. If it's a category Archive, it displays the name of the category as the title. And so on.

## Under the hood

The Archive Title module is a "shortcut" module. It's actually a Heading module with a field connection set to **Archive title** in the **Heading** field. When you open this module for editing, you'll have the regular Heading module settings, such as:

  * Adding an optional link
  * Style settings for text, including font family
  * Special settings for mobile devices
  * The usual **Advanced** tab settings
