Most WordPress themes support archive, singular, and 404 layouts. However, to support the Beaver Themer header, footer, and part layouts, themes must allow its header, footer, and parts to be removed using hooks.

Beaver Themer was built to fully support the following themes:

  * [Beaver Builder Theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/wordpress-framework-theme/)
  * [Genesis](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/go/genesis) – Full-width Themer layouts are supported.

  * [GeneratePress](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/go/generatepress) – Full-width Themer layouts are supported.

  * [Storefront theme from WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/)  
  **Note:** There has been an issue in which sticky, shrink, and overlay header options in Beaver Themer don't work with the Storefront theme.

If you have any problem with Beaver Themer compatibility with these themes, contact the Beaver Builder Support team.
