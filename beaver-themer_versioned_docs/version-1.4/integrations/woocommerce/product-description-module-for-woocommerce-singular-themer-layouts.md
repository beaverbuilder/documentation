The Product Description module is in the **WooCommerce modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type layout in Beaver Themer and you've assigned a single product page as the location.

## Module settings

This module has a **General** tab and an **Advanced** tab.

On the **General** tab there is one setting:

  * **Type** (Short description, Full description)

The short and full description come from what you've entered for each product. If you have **Type** set to **Short description** and you preview a product\ without a short description, you'll see the placeholder `woocommerce_template_single_excerpt` displayed. In the published product page, if a product has no short description then nothing is displayed.

:::tip **Tip**
There are two modules that can display the full product description: the Production Description module and the Product Tabs module. The Product Tabs module displays the full description in the context of appearing on the **Description** tab, with an **Additional Information** tab if there are product attributes and a **Review** tab if reviews are enabled for a specific product. The initial WooCommerce Singular-type layout for single products uses the Product Description module for the short description and the Product Tabs module for the full description set into tabs.

On the **Advanced** tab, you can customize margins, responsive layout, visibility, animation, and assign an ID or class name.
