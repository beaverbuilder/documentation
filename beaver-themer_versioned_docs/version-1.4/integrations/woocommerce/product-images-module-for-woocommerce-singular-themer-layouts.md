The Product Images module is in the **WooCommerce modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type layout in Beaver Themer and you've assigned a single product page as the location.

The Product Images module has the following properties when it appears on the product page:

  * It displays the featured image set for the product. If the product has gallery images, it displays those images below the main image.
  * Like the standard WooCommerce product image on a single product page, there's a magnifying glass icon that zooms in on the image when you mouse over it and displays a larger version when you click the image.
  * If you set the **Sale Flash** setting to **Show** in the Product Images module, then any single product that has a sale price will display a **Sale** box in the upper left corner.

In the Themer layout, if you have **Sale Flash** set to **Show** and preview a product page that doesn't have a sale price, you'll see `woocommerce_show_product_sale_flash` set above the photo, to let you know that the Sale box will appear only when a sale price is listed for a product.
