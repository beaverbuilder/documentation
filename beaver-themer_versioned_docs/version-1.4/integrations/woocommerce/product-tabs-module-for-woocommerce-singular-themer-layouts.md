The Product Tabs module is in the **WooCommerce modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type layout in Beaver Themer and you've assigned a single product page as the location.

The Product Tabs module displays the product tabs that you get on a standard WooCommerce product page, including:

  * Tab 1: Full description of product  
  If the product's full description field is blank, this tab isn't visible.
  * Tab 2: Additional Information  
  Additional information includes weight, dimensions, and product attributes, as in the following screenshot. If there is no additional information specified in the product, this tab isn't visible.

  * Tab 3: Reviews  
  Displays a list of the customer reviews with their ratings. If reviews are not enabled, this tab isn't visible

## Module settings

This module has only an **Advanced** tab, where you can customize margins, responsive layout, visibility, animation, and assign an ID or class name.
