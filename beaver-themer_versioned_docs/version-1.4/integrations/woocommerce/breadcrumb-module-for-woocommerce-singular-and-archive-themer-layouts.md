The Breadcrumb module is in the **WooCommerce modules** category, which appears when you're editing a Singular or Archive-type layout in Beaver Themer and the WooCommerce plugin is installed.

The breadcrumb path is standard WooCommerce functionality. If you have more than one category assigned to a product, WooCommerce uses the first category it finds as the path.

To change the breadcrumb path functionality, such as the Home page link, you can use a plugin such as [WooCommerce Breadcrumbs](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-breadcrumbs/).

## Module settings

This module has a **Style** tab and an **Advanced** tab.

On the **Style** tab of the **Breadcrumb** module, you can customize the following settings:

  * Alignment (left center, right)
  * Font size
  * Text color

On the **Advanced** tab, you can customize margins, responsive layout, visibility, animation, and assign an ID or class name.
