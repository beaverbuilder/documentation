The article covers all available field connections for [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) plugin.

The field connections listed in this article supports both the free and the premium versions of The Events Calendar plugin with the [Event Field](#event-field) becoming available only when the premium version is installed.

:::tip
Some of the date field connections allow you to configure the date format using PHP `date()` function. You can learn more from the [WordPress formatting date and time](https://wordpress.org/support/article/formatting-date-and-time/) article.
:::

## Event Date and Time

Outputs an event's date and time e.g. August 1st @ 12:00 am - 9:00 am UTC+0. All day events return only the date e.g. August 1st.

The field connection uses [`tribe_events_event_schedule_details()`](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/functions/tribe_events_event_schedule_details/) function and has no format options. The date format can be adjusted from **Events > Settings > Display** within your WordPress dashboard.

```markup

```

## Event Start Date

Outputs an event's start date e.g. August 1st with the option to set the date format using the `format=''` attribute.

```markup
[wpbb post:the_events_calendar_start_date format='']
```

If `format=''` remains empty the format will default to what is configured in **Events > Settings > Display** within your WordPress dashboard.

## Event Start Time

Outputs an event's start time e.g. 12:00am.

```markup
