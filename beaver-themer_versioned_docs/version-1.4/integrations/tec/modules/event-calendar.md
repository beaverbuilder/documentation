The Event Calendar module is in **The Events Calendar Modules** section of the **Themer modules group** in the Content panel when you're editing an Archive-type Themer layout in Beaver Themer and you have The Events Calendar plugin installed.

The Event Calendar module inserts the calendar that you normally see on the _mysite.com_ /events page. The published page will show the view that is set in **Events > Settings > Display > Default view.** If you have it set to list, the Events page will display List view.

:::note **Notes**
* When you insert the Event Calendar module into your Themer layout, it will always display the Calendar view, even when the **Default view** is set to **List**.
* When you publish the Themer layout, the URL is still set to _mysite.com/fl-theme-layout/events-archive/_. To see the correct view of the page, change the URL to _mysite.com/events_.
:::

The Event Calendar module has only a **Style** tab and an **Advanced** tab. For style, you can set the foreground color and background color of the calendar and the text color and background color of error notices. The **Advanced** tab has the usual Beaver Builder settings.
