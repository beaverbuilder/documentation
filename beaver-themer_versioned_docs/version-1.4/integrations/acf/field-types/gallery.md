The Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Gallery field is supported in Beaver Themer via a field connection to a [Gallery module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/gallery/).

## Getting started

To get started, create your Gallery field in ACF and add your images to the field. In your Beaver Builder or Beaver Themer layout, add a Gallery module and connect the Gallery module's **Photos** option to your ACF gallery field.

## Shortcode

Beaver Themer field connections **do not support** the ACF Gallery field. A Gallery module is the only way to output the gallery field.
