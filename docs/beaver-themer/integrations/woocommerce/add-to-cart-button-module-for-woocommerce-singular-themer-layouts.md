description: The Add to Cart Button module lets you add the Add to Cart button plus product variations to your Themer Singular Layout for WooCommerce.
---

The Add to Cart Button module is in the **WooCommerce modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type layout in Beaver Themer and you've assigned a single product page as the location.

Besides the **Add to Cart** button, this module also displays the following controls when they apply (the same as default WooCommerce behavior).

* A **Quantity** selection list
* The **Add to Cart** button
* Variation labels and options if the product has variations set, as shown in this screenshot:

## Module settings

### Style tab

**Text** section:

* **Text color**
* **Text hover color**

**Background** section:

* **Background color**
* **Background hover color**

The colors are applied as follows to the three button states:

  * **Disabled** (the state that applies if there are variations and an option hasn't been selected yet)  
  A lighter version of the background and text color.
  * **Enabled** (ready to be clicked)  
  The default or custom background and text color.
  * **Hover** (cursor moves over the button)  
  A darker version of the background and text color.

### Advanced tab

There's are the standard features on the [**Advanced** tab](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab/index.md).

:::note **Note**
The **Advanced** settings apply to the entire module block. Using the screenshot above as an example if you set a **Slide left** animation, the variation (mug color), quantity, and **Add to Cart** button will all slide left as a block.
