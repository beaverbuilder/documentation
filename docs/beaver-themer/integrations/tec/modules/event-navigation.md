## Availability

The Event Navigation module appears in **The Events Calendar** section of the **Themer modules** group in the [Content panel](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/content-panel) when you're editing a [Singular-type](../../../layout-types-modules/singular-layout-type/themer-singular-layout-type.md) Themer layout.

## Style tab

The **Style** tab has two options allowing to set the **Previous** and **Next** link text. 

The default values are:

* **Previous**: `<span>&laquo;</span> %title%`.
* **Next**: `%title% <span>&raquo;</span>`.

The `&laquo;` and `&raquo;` are [HTML Entities](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_entities_4.asp) to display the arrows. You can replace these with anything you like such as Font Awesome icons.

The `%title%` is a placeholder for the event title.

## The Advanced tab

There are all the usual [Advanced tab](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab) settings for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
