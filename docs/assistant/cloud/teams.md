In this article, we explain what a team is, how it can be used to help collaboration, organization, share creative assets, and set roles for team members.


## What is a Team?

A team consists of multiple users who have access to the same libraries. Each user can be configured with unique access controls. By collaborating and sharing templates and creative assets, team members can reuse them across projects.

:::info
You need to have a Team Account in order to create teams. You can upgrade to a Team Account from the **Billing** tab on your account Page.

:::caution
A Team subscription includes 3 User Accounts. Additional users can be added for $5 per month each. When a free account user joins a team, their account **is not** upgraded to premium.
