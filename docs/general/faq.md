## Account, Billing & Subscription

### Do I lose my work if I don't renew my subscription?
Our annual subscription fees are there so we can continue to provide you with updates and outstanding support. (See our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/). Also don't forget the great discount we offer at renewal time.

Here's what happens if you choose not to renew and your license expires. You can't download Beaver Builder products anymore, but you can continue to install and use any versions of Beaver Builder that you've already downloaded. So essentially Beaver Builder freezes at the version you have installed when your license expires. You won't be able to contact Beaver Builder Support for help.

We cannot guarantee how long older versions of Beaver Builder will work if you update other parts of your site or platform. This is because updates to PHP WordPress, or other plugins can affect the functionality of Beaver Builder products, and we often issue updates to stay compatible. It's wise from a security standpoint to keep all your site's software up to date.

For these reasons, if you decide not to renew your license, we advise you to start thinking about moving your content to another solution. Unlike other page builders that use shortcodes, if you deactivate the Beaver Builder plugin, the text and images are automatically made available in the WordPress editor.

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### Is there a discount on annual renewals?
Yes! We offer a 40% discount on renewals so long as you renew within two weeks of your license expiring.

The renewal discount is automatically applied during checkout when renewed within the 2-week renewal period.

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### What's your refund policy?
Although we hope you’ll never want a refund, we'll be happy to provide one if it’s requested within 30 days of purchase, upgrade, or renewal of any product. Just submit a Support ticket and let us know what you want to change.

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### Will my license renew automatically?
Yes. If you purchased Beaver Builder any time after May 1st, 2017, your license will automatically renew one year after the purchase date.

If you purchased before May 1st, 2017, you will not be automatically billed. You'll get an annual reminder of the renewal period and renewal discount and must renew your license manually if you want to continue (and we'll be delighted).

☝️ [Top](#)

---

###  Can I upgrade my subscription after signing up?
Yes, you can [upgrade from the free version of Beaver Builder](/general/pre-sales.md/#upgrade-from-free-to-premium-version-of-beaver-builder) to any premium version or [from any premium subscription to a higher one](/general/account-billing/upgrade-your-premium-license.md). If you've already purchased a Premium subscription, your new premium subscription is prorated for the difference in cost.

You can also [downgrade from one premium version to another](/general/account-billing/downgrade-to-a-lower-version-of-beaver-builder.md/#downgrade-to-another-premium-version) or [from a premium version to the free version](/general/account-billing/downgrade-to-a-lower-version-of-beaver-builder.md/#downgrade-from-a-premium-version-to-the-free-beaver-builder-lite-plugin).

## Beaver Builder

### Is Beaver Builder compatible with Gutenberg?
Probably everyone has heard of Gutenberg. It's the project name for
[the WordPress block editor](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) that shipped with WordPress 5. It's also known as the block editor.

The Beaver Builder plugin is compatible with the WordPress 5 block editor
in the same way that it's compatible with the "classic" WordPress text editor.
Depending on whether you set WordPress to prefer the block editor or use a plugin to maintain the
classic editor, you can move text and images between Beaver Builder and the WordPress editor on a limited scale.

See [the detailed article about how Beaver Builder works with the WordPress Standard (block) editor](/beaver-builder/management-migration/convert-content-between-wordpress-5-and-beaver-builder.md).

:::tip Tip:
The responsive default heading and text styles that you can assign at
**Customize > General > Headings** and **Customize > General > Text** in the
Beaver Builder Theme apply as default settings in Beaver Builder and Beaver
Themer layouts, but they also apply as default settings to headings and text
in WordPress block  layouts, though they will not display until you preview or view
the page.
:::

We think Beaver Builder is far superior to the features that the WorPress Standard Editor offers,
but we encourage you to try both the Standard Editor and Beaver Builder for yourself. If you
have a Beaver Builder license, you can download the current version of Beaver
Builder from the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/)
page, or you can install the free Beaver Builder Lite plugin, or you can try the [Page Builder Demo](http://demo.wpbeaverbuilder.com).

Once you try both page builders side by side, we'd value your feedback on your
experience. The best mechanism to get feedback directly to us is to [submit a Support ticket](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder-support/).

☝️ [Top](#)

### Is Beaver Builder a plugin or a theme?

The Beaver Builder page builder is a plugin, but some of our premium packages include a framework Beaver Builder Theme, as described here.

Our standard premium package includes just the Beaver Builder page builder plugin. The page builder
is a visual layout tool to help you build layouts and add
content to WordPress pages. The Beaver Builder plugin works with almost any
theme, but see [the list of incompatible themes](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/known-beaver-builder-incompatibilities.md#themes).

Our Pro and Agency packages include both the Beaver Builder plugin and the
Beaver Builder Theme. The Beaver Builder Theme has lean code, great
customization options, and of course it integrates perfectly with the Beaver
Builder plugin. Another advantage of using the Beaver Builder Theme is that you can go straight to our stellar Support team for any questions, whether it pertains to the plugin or the theme.

☝️ [Top](#)

### Can I modify my theme's header and footer with Beaver Builder?

It depends on which theme and which Beaver Builder products you have.

The [Beaver Builder plugin](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/) is used for
layouts in the content area of your site, not the theme areas (header and
footer). See [this knowledge base article](/beaver-builder/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-builder.md#plugin-vs-theme-vs-beaver-themer) for a diagram of the content area versus the parts of the page controlled by the WordPress theme.

The [Beaver Themer plugin](/beaver-themer/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-themer.md) is an add-on to the Beaver Builder plugin, and it can be used to create layouts in just about every area of the page *besides*
the content area, plus pages that WordPress normally generates on the fly,
such as blog index and archive pages. You can also control which pages of your
site these Themer layouts apply to. Here's [an article](/beaver-themer/getting-started/primer-on-wordpress-content-and-theme-areas-themer.md) with more information about the parts of the page that Beaver Themer can control.

:::note **Note**
Beaver Themer overrides your theme's layout on the pages to which it
applies, so your theme must support the removal of headers and footers with
hooks. See the [list of themes that currently support Beaver Themer](/beaver-themer/management-compatibility/beaver-themer-supported-themes.md).
:::

The Pro and Agency packages of the Beaver Builder plugin include the Beaver
Builder Theme, a very versatile theme framework that is simple to learn, the
header and footer are very customizable if you don't use Beaver Themer, and
it's fully compatible with Beaver Themer.

As an alternative to Beaver Themer, some Beaver Builder users [create a transparent header](/bb-theme/defaults-for-layouts-content/headers-nav-menus/merge-page-content-into-the-header.md) with the Beaver Builder plugin, or they suppress the header and footer in their theme, or they use a third-party header/footer plugin compatible with Beaver Builder.

### Is there an easy way to convert my website to Beaver Builder?

The short answer is there's probably no automated tool to convert website
content into Beaver Builder, but the solution may still be fairly easy!

Many other page builders work by adding shortcodes to the WordPress editor. This makes it nearly impossible
to easily migrate your content to any other format. In fact, that may be a
reason why you're considering or have chosen Beaver Builder.

If the old site had pages created using the standard WordPress text editor,
the text and media in the WordPress editor will convert to a single Text
Editor module when you open it in Beaver Builder, as shown in the following
screenshot.

![](/img/faq-easy-convert-bb.png)

That's a start – at least your text is now in a Beaver Builder layout. To get
the beautiful layout you're dreaming of, you'll want to break up that content
and use it in various modules. For example, you could pull the photo out of
the Text Editor module and add it to a Photo module. Or you could use a
Callout module instead of a Text module if you want to add a button and links.
After you create the modules, you may want to add some custom styling or
positioning too either in the module's settings or using custom CSS.

We're betting that even if a tool existed, by the time you did the conversion
and then the mopping up, you can build a page from scratch even faster. We
frequently get feedback from ecstatic new customers at how quickly they are
able to get up to speed and create pages and websites from scratch in record
time. Displaying your old website pages in HTML and copying content chunks
over into Beaver Builder modules is quite possibly the most efficient way to
go about it.

Remember, if you ever deactivate the Beaver Builder plugin, your text and
images are preserved in the WordPress text editor, minus layouts and style.

### Can I create my own modules for Beaver Builder?

Yes! See our [custom module developer guide](/beaver-builder/developer/custom-modules.mdx) article in the Knowledge Base. The guide contains a example plugin with a custom module that you can download.

You can also create custom WordPress widgets and use them with Beaver
Builder's WordPress Widgets modules anywhere in your content layout and in the
Beaver Builder Theme's widget menu.

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### Does Beaver Builder work with Posts and Custom Post Types?

Yes! By default, Beaver Builder is only enabled for pages, but you can easily
enable it for posts and custom post types from the Beaver Builder settings by
going to **Settings > Beaver Builder > Post Types** from the WordPress admin
panel.

Note that Beaver Builder is used for layouts in [the content area](/beaver-themer/getting-started/primer-on-wordpress-content-and-theme-areas-themer.md) of a page or post. To create layouts in other parts of the page
such as headers, footers, and post meta, and to display custom fields in your
layouts, that's where [Beaver Themer](/beaver-themer/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-themer.md) comes in.

### How does Beaver Builder's white labeling feature work?

Our Agency package allows you to “white label” Beaver Builder and give your
clients a truly white-glove experience. White labeling allows you to replace
the words Beaver Builder and the Beaver Builder logo with
your own company's name or logo.

:::note **Note**
White labeling only applies to the back end of your website. There
are no advertisements or mentions of Beaver Builder on the front end of your
site.
:::

For more information about the Agency version and white labeling the Beaver Builder plugin and theme, search for the term _Agency_ in our [Knowledge Base](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com).

### Can I include Beaver Builder as part of a premium or free WordPress theme?

We don't support bundling or redistributing the premium versions of Beaver
Builder with a theme, but you're free to do this with [the free
version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/).

There are several helpful features for theme authors bundling the free version
of Beaver Builder with a theme. You can include an affiliate link via a
filter, so if anyone upgrades Beaver Builder after learning about it from your
theme, you'll get a 25% commission on the sale. We also have a feature that
enables theme authors to build and include pre-designed templates with their
theme.

For more information, see this [blog post about bundling the free version](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/integrating-a-page-builder-with-your-wordpress-themes/) of Beaver Builder or [this Knowledge Base article about our theme author templates feature](/beaver-builder/developer/how-to-tips/theme-author-templates.md).

### What modules are included in Beaver Builder?


For all premium versions, there is a complete list of modules and descriptions
of the modules in any of the premium versions of Beaver Builder plugin here in
the [Knowledge Base](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/module-overview.md).

The free version of Beaver Builder contains the following subset of modules:

* [Audio](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/audio.md)
* [Button](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/button/button.md)
* [Heading](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/heading.md)
* [HTML](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/html.md)
* [Icon](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/icon-and-icon-group.md)
* [Photo](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/photo/photo.md)
* [Sidebar](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/sidebar.md)
* [Text Editor](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/text-editor/text.md)
* [Video](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/video/video.md)

### Difference between multisite support and network-wide settings?

Our Pro package is "multisite capable," meaning it supports WordPress
multisite installations. With the Pro package, you’ll need to configure Beaver
Builder settings on each site.

Our Agency package has a network-wide settings panel. With the Agency package,
you can configure Beaver Builder on all of your sites in the network from one
place, then override those settings on a site-by-site basis.

### Does Beaver Builder work with e-commerce plugins?

Among the various eCommerce solutions, the Beaver Builder plugin is most fully integrated with WooCommerce. There's a large collection of articles in our [Knowledge Base](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com) about the integration of all of our Beaver Builder products with WooCommerce.

Our Beaver Themer plugin also has integrations with two other e-commerce platforms: [BigCommerce](/beaver-themer/integrations/bigcommerce/beaver-themer-layouts-for-bigcommerce.md) and [Easy Digital Downloads](/beaver-themer/integrations/easy-digital-downloads/beaver-themer-and-the-edd-plugin.md), with some special modules for both archive and single product
pages.

For other eCommerce solutions, Beaver Builder supports both widgets and
shortcodes. If the eCommerce plugin provides either a widget or a shortcode to
render products or a cart, then you can build your storefront using Beaver
Builder.

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### Is Beaver Builder compatible with X theme or Y plugin?

We do our best to make sure Beaver Builder is compatible with as many other
plugins and themes as possible. The best way to test Beaver Builder with your
plugin stack is to try installing [Beaver Builder Lite, which is
free.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/)

You have 30 days to try out any premium version after purchase, and if for any
reason Beaver Builder doesn’t work with your theme or plugin, our Support team
will work with you to see what can be done!

Here's a list of [known incompatibilities](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/known-beaver-builder-incompatibilities.md/#themes).

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### Does Beaver Builder support shortcodes?

Yup! It definitely does. Shortcodes enable you to use your _other_ favorite
plugins along with Beaver Builder.

You can also create shortcodes for Beaver Builder modules and insert them into
other parts of your site.

See [the shortcodes article](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/shortcodes/use-shortcodes-in-your-layouts.md) for more information.

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### Can I include Beaver Builder as part of my hosted website builder platform?

Yes! The features included in our Agency subscription are geared towards those
that wish to create their own DIY hosted website publishing business (like
SquareSpace).

While using Beaver Builder as part of a website builder is supported, we do
not support bundling or redistributing Beaver Builder as part of a traditional
web hosting product. To differentiate, if a user has access to the WordPress
admin area, web server backend, or PHP code (i.e., FTP access, backups, SSH,
etc.), we consider this standard hosting. In short, a custom administration
and onboarding process would need to be in place.

You are free to auto-install or bundle [the free version of Beaver Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) with a traditional hosting package, though.

To learn more about large-scale integrations or hosting partnerships, please
[contact us](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/contact/)!

### Does Beaver Builder support third-party widgets?

Yes, though some third-party widgets may require a modification to get them to work in the front end so they're compatible with Beaver Builder layouts. Both third-party widgets and the default WordPress
widgets show up in Beaver Builder's WordPress Widgets modules and in Beaver
Builder Theme's widget menu. See [the article on WordPress Widgets modules](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/wordpress-widgets.md) for more information.

## Beaver Themer

### What's the difference between Beaver Builder Theme and Beaver Themer?

The [Beaver Builder Theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/wordpress-framework-theme/) is a WordPress theme. The [Beaver Builder plugin](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com) and [Beaver Themer](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/) are both plugins.

Every WordPress installation requires a theme. Themes control the header and
footer on the page, as well as options such as a sidebar or footer for widgets
and how blog posts are displayed. Themes also usually allow you to set some
global styling options for your pages, such as fonts and colors.

The Beaver Builder plugin lets you easily create layouts in the content area
of the page. That's the part of the page that is not controlled by a theme.
For more information on the difference between the content area and theme
areas of a page, see [the primer article](/beaver-themer/getting-started/primer-on-wordpress-content-and-theme-areas-themer.md).

The Beaver Themer plugin is an add-on plugin that uses Beaver Builder to
create layouts that you can apply anywhere on the page _except_ the content
area. For example, you could create a Themer layout for a header and use it to
replace the standard theme header on all pages on your site or a subset.

Which of the three Beaver Builder products do you need?

The Beaver Builder plugin is the base product, and it's used for creating
content layouts. It works with most themes and does not require the Beaver
Builder Theme or Beaver Themer.

The Beaver Builder Theme is a well-coded framework theme that is tightly
integrated with the Beaver Builder plugin. The Beaver Builder plugin plus
Beaver Builder Theme give you enough flexibility that you'll probably never
have to buy another theme.

Beaver Themer is the add-on to get if you want to do any of the following:

* Create header or footer layouts that override your theme.
* Create layouts for index, archive, search, and 404 pages that are dynamically generated by WordPress.
* Create layouts to display single posts, which override the parts of the page that lie outside the content area.  
  With this type of layout, you use the WordPress editor to create the content that appears in the content area of the page.

* Create layout "parts" that can be inserted above or below headers, footers, or the content area and specify where they will appear.  
  This layout type is ideal for inserting items like banners on a number of
pages.

Beaver Themer requires the Beaver Builder plugin, but it doesn't require the
Beaver Builder Theme, even though all three are designed to integrate well
together. See the [list of themes that are fully supported by Beaver Themer](/beaver-themer/management-compatibility/beaver-themer-supported-themes.md).

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### What is the difference between the Beaver Builder Theme and Beaver Themer?

Beaver Themer is an extension to Page Builder and it is a WordPress plugin. When using a supported theme, Beaver Themer enables you to build headers/footers and create templates using Page Builder's drag and drop interface. This functionality was generally only possible before by editing a theme's PHP template files.

### Which Beaver Builder Packages include Beaver Themer?

Beaver Themer is not included with any of the Beaver Builder packages (Standard, Pro, or Agency). It must be purchased separately.

### Does Beaver Themer work with the lite version?

Unfortunately, Beaver Themer is an add-on for the premium version of Page Builder and is not compatible with the lite version.

☝️ [Top](#)

---

### What themes can I use Beaver Themer with?

Most themes support archive, singular, and 404 layouts out of the box. However, to support the Theme Builder header, footer, and part layouts, themes must be built a certain way.

Currently, Beaver Themer pairs well with the [Beaver Builder Theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/wordpress-framework-theme/) and is supported by [several 3rd party themes listed here](/beaver-themer/management-compatibility/beaver-themer-supported-themes.md).

### Does Beaver Themer require Page Builder?

Yes! Beaver Themer is an add-on to Page Builder and will not function if Page Builder is not installed alongside.

### How many sites can I use Beaver Themer on?

You can use Beaver Themer on an unlimited number of sites.

## BB Theme

### Do I need to use the Beaver Builder theme with the Beaver Builder plugin?

No! Absolutely not. The Beaver Builder plugin was designed to work with nearly
all themes. (See the [list of known theme incompatibilities](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/known-beaver-builder-incompatibilities.md/#themes).)

We do think Beaver Builder Theme is a great choice, for the reasons below.

#### Fully integrated with the Beaver Builder plugin

WordPress themes can be really bloated with code. The Beaver Builder Theme is
fully integrated with the Beaver Builder plugin to maximize functionality and
performance. For example, both theme and plugin settings are taken into
account before Google fonts are loaded onto a page. You also have options such
as whether to load the set of Font Awesome icons on every page, or only pages
on which an icon appears.

Also, using both the plugin and theme makes Beaver Builder a one-stop shop: if
you have a problem with either plugin or theme, you can contact our great
Support team.

#### Fully responsive, built on Bootstrap

If you're familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap, you'll be right at home
with the Beaver Builder Theme. It has Bootstrap baked into its core. When
writing custom styles for Beaver Builder, keep in mind that it follows the
same “mobile first” approach as Bootstrap.

####  Font Awesome Support

We’ve also baked in support for Font Awesome. It's easy to use any number of
their amazing icons in your custom child theme.

#### Customization options

If you're a developer, here's a [link to the theme hooks available for the theme](https://hooks.wpbeaverbuilder.com/bb-theme/). This list is automatically updated with each release.

### Is there a marketplace for selling our custom modules or extensions?

Not yet, but this is something that is on our radar. We still aren’t sure if
there is enough demand for a marketplace to justify the time it would take to
setup. If you’re interested in selling your custom Beaver Builder modules or

### I tried the demo, but what other settings are there?

If you've tried out [the demo at the Beaver Builder
website](http://demo.wpbeaverbuilder.com/), you already know how much
flexibility you have in setting up layouts, the variety of content modules
available, and the ease in changing settings on individual modules.

In the demo, you can also play around with saving modules, rows, and content
templates for reuse. You can also explore the **Tools** panel, where you can
change certain settings globally or  add CSS or JavaScript code that applies
either to a particular page or site-wide.

What you can't see in the demo is the **Settings** panel for Beaver Builder,
which can be accessed from **Settings > Beaver Builder** in the WordPress
admin panel. Here's [an overview of the Settings panel](/beaver-builder/management-migration/settings-overview.md).

### How do I find out what's changed in each release?

Each release comes with a change log that describes enhancements and bug
fixes. You can access the change logs for all of the Beaver Builder products
in several ways.

* Use this link to go directly to [https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/change-logs/](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/change-logs/) .
* From the **Installed plugins** page in WordPress, click the **Change log** link underneath the Beaver Builder plugin
* If you're logged into your Beaver Builder account at [wpbeaverbuilder.com](https://wpbeaverbuilder.com), mouse over **Account** in the menu and choose **Change logs**.
