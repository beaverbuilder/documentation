Probably everyone has heard of Gutenberg. It's the project name for
[the WordPress block editor](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) that shipped with WordPress 5. It's also known as the block editor.

The Beaver Builder plugin is compatible with the WordPress 5 block editor
in the same way that it's compatible with the "classic" WordPress text editor.
Depending on whether you set WordPress to prefer the block editor or use a plugin to maintain the
classic editor, you can move text and images between Beaver Builder and the WordPress editor on a limited scale.

See [the detailed article about how Beaver Builder works with the WordPress Standard (block) editor](/beaver-builder/management-migration/convert-content-between-wordpress-5-and-beaver-builder.md).

:::tip Tip:
The responsive default heading and text styles that you can assign at
**Customize > General > Headings** and **Customize > General > Text** in the
Beaver Builder Theme apply as default settings in Beaver Builder and Beaver
Themer layouts, but they also apply as default settings to headings and text
in WordPress block  layouts, though they will not display until you preview or view
the page.

We think Beaver Builder is far superior to the features that the WorPress Standard Editor offers,
but we encourage you to try both the Standard Editor and Beaver Builder for yourself. If you
have a Beaver Builder license, you can download the current version of Beaver
Builder from the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/)
page, or you can install the free Beaver Builder Lite plugin, or you can try the [Page Builder Demo](http://demo.wpbeaverbuilder.com).

Once you try both page builders side by side, we'd value your feedback on your
experience. The best mechanism to get feedback directly to us is to [submit a Support ticket](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder-support/).
