You can upgrade your license from one premium version to another at any time.
When you upgrade, you’ll only be charged the cost difference between your
license and the one you’re upgrading to, prorated to expire one year after
your original purchase.

For example, if you buy a license on January 1 and upgrade on July 1, you will
be charged for a half year of the difference between the two licenses' annual
prices. The license expiration date remains the same, so on the following
January 1, your license expires and you can renew at the price of your current
package, minus the renewal discount if you renew within the discount window.

:::important Other upgrade/downgrade options:

  * You can [downgrade from one premium version to another](/general/account-billing/downgrade-to-a-lower-version-of-beaver-builder.md).
  * You can [upgrade from the free Lite version to a premium version](/general/pre-sales#upgrade-from-free-to-premium-version-of-beaver-buidler.md).

Here are the steps to purchase and install your premium upgrade.

## 1. Purchase your upgrade

  1. Go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and scroll to the **My Subscriptions** section.
  2. Click the upgrade package that you want.  
Only eligible upgrades are shown in this section. If you already have the
Agency version, you won't see any upgrade options.
  3.  Complete the checkout process.  
Your license number remains the same but is now associated with the upgrade
version.

## 2. Download and install the upgrade

Follow the [regular installation instructions](/beaver-builder/getting-started/install-beaver-builder.md) to download and install your new version of the plugin.

:::important **Info**
If you don't install the upgraded version immediately, your previous
premium version of the plugin will continue to notify you of updates on the
WordPress **Plugins** menu.
