If you purchased Beaver Builder or Beaver Themer on or after May 1st, 2017,
your license will renew automatically. Otherwise, it will require a manual
renewal.

If you are set up for autorenewal, you can cancel it, and when your
subscription expires you can either manually renew (you'll get a notice about
the renewal, and the renewal discount will still apply) or let your
subscription lapse. See this article about [what happens if you don't renew your subscription](/general/faq.md/#do-i-lose-my-work-if-i-dont-renew-my-subscription).

:::note **Note**
If you cancel autorenewal, we cannot reinstate it later.
:::

**To cancel automatic renewal:**

  1. Go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and scroll to the **My Subscriptions** section.
  2. Click the **Cancel Renewal** button next to the subscription you'd like to cancel.  

You can still renew your subscription manually, but it won't autorenew.  

 **Note:**
 If you don't see the **Cancel Renewal** button, it means you're not in the autorenewal program and you'll have to renew it manually each year.


:::note **Note**
If you don't renew and no longer have a license you'll no longer be
able to download products or get product updates. See our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/).
