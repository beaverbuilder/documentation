If you purchased Beaver Builder or Beaver Themer on or after May 1st, 2017,
your license will renew automatically. Otherwise, it will require a manual
renewal.

If you are set up for autorenewal, you can cancel it, and when your
subscription expires you can either manually renew or let your
subscription lapse. See this article about [what
happens if you don't renew your subscription](/general/faq/do-i-lose-my-work-if-i-dont-renew-my-subscription.md).

:::info
If you cancel autorenewal, we cannot reinstate it later.
:::

**To cancel automatic renewal:**

1. Go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and scroll to the **My Subscriptions** section.
2. Click the **Cancel Renewal** button next to the subscription you'd like to cancel.  

You can still renew your subscription manually, but it won't autorenew.  

**Note:**
If you don't see the **Cancel Renewal** button, it means you're not in the autorenewal program and you'll have to renew it manually each year.


:::info
If you don't renew and no longer have a license you'll no longer be
able to download products or get product updates. See our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/).
