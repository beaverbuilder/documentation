### Can I use Beaver Builder with any theme

Beaver Builder has been developed to work with almost any theme. However,
there are some exceptions to this rule such as:

  * themes bundled with other page builders
  * themes designed to work with other page builders
  * themes that don't use the WordPress loop
  * a theme has its own version of jQuery  enqueued or hardcoded

If you're using a premium third-party theme, you could test it out by installing the Beaver Builder Lite version available from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) to see if you encounter any issues. If you don't, then you shouldn't have any issues with a premium version of Beaver Builder.

We'd also like to point out that once you try Beaver Builder, and especially [the Beaver Themer add-on](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/) to Beaver Builder, you may change your idea of what you want your theme to do. 

Beaver Builder builds beautiful layouts of [the content area of the page](/beaver-builder/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-builder.md#plugin-vs-theme-vs-beaver-themer), including sidebars with widgets or other content. You can save your own [layout templates](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/layout-templates-overview.md) or [individual rows, columns and modules](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/save-a-row-column-or-module-for-reuse.md) for reuse elsewhere. 

Beaver Themer lets you essentially override your theme to build your own layouts for headers, footers, archive pages, single posts, page banners, and more. Beaver Themer gives you far more control than you could ever get with a theme. In fact, you may find yourself wanting a theme that is well coded for performance and then gets out of the way, rather than a theme that provides all the bells and whistles that were needed before page builders.

If you decide to change your theme, our [Beaver Builder framework theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/wordpress-framework-theme/) is fully integrated with Beaver Builder and comes with two of our premium versions, or you can choose from [other themes that are known to support Beaver Builder and Beaver Themer](/beaver-themer/management-compatibility/beaver-themer-supported-themes.md).

### Does Beaver Builder work with other CMS's

Beaver Builder is a page builder plugin for WordPress and therefore, is only
compatible with the WordPress CMS. The same goes for our BB Theme and Beaver
Themer.

You're free to fork the Beaver Builder lite version available from
[WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/)
and add your own support for other content management systems.

### Can I upgrade a license after I have already purchased one?

You can upgrade your license at any time. When you upgrade, you’ll only be charged the cost difference between your license and the one you’re upgrading to, prorated to expire one year after your original purchase.

☝️ [Top](#)

### What happens if I don't renew my license? Will Beaver Builder still work?

If you choose not to renew and your license expires. You can't download Beaver Builder products anymore, but you can continue to install and use any versions of Beaver Builder that you've already downloaded. So essentially Beaver Builder freezes at the version you have installed when your license expires. You won't be able to contact Beaver Builder Support for help.

We cannot guarantee how long older versions of Beaver Builder will work if you update other parts of your site or platform. This is because updates to PHP WordPress, or other plugins can affect the functionality of Beaver Builder products, and we often issue updates to stay compatible. It's wise from a security standpoint to keep all your site's software up to date.

For these reasons, if you decide not to renew your license, we advise you to start thinking about moving your content to another solution. Unlike other page builders that use shortcodes, if you deactivate the Beaver Builder plugin, the text and images are automatically made available in the WordPress editor.

### Can I use Beaver Builder to create websites for clients?

You must use your license on websites that you own or manage. You may use your license on a client site in situations in which you maintain an ongoing relationship with your client as a consultant. By using your license on a client site, you acknowledge and agree that your client will come to you for support.
