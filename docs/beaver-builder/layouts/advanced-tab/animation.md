The **Animation** section in the Advanced tab lets you apply an entrance animation effect to any row, column or module when it becomes visible for the first time on a page.

:::info
Animations in Beaver Builder cannot be looped and are triggered once upon page load. If you want to create animations on a loop, you'll need to use the @keyframes rule and write your own CSS animations.

The [W3Schools @keyframes](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.php) article provides more information.

3. Select an animation effect from the **Animation** drop-down menu.

:::tip
During the delay period the item will not display, so don't set the delay time so long that your visitors scroll past the item without seeing it.
