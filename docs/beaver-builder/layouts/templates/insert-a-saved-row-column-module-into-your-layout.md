The procedure for inserting a saved row, column, or module is the same whether
it's standard or global.

  * In the Content panel, click the **Saved** tab, then drag the saved row, column, or module into your layout.

:::note **Note**
You can't drag a column from the **Saved** tab inside another column in your layout because of the possibility that the saved column can have nested columns, which would exceed the limit of one level of nesting. See [more information about column limits](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/column-layouts-overview.md/#column-limits)

A workaround is to drag the column into a row as a main column and inspect it. If it has no nested columns, you can move it from there into another column.
:::

Global rows, columns, or modules have an orange overlay after they are
inserted. Any modification you make to them will affect the saved version and
all other instances in your site. Standard rows, columns, or modules don't
have any special formatting in your layout because they no longer have any
association with the saved version.
