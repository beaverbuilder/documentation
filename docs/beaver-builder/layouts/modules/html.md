The HTML module lets you insert custom code and markup into your layouts that
is rendered directly to the HTML output.

## Uses of the HTML module

Use the HTML module to add text, markup, and code such as HTML table markup,
shortcodes, or JavaScript. The HTML module is better for adding markup and
code than the Text Editor module, because the WordPress editor instance
embedded in the Text Editor module can try to insert its own markup, such as
`<p>` tags.

In the screenshot above, the `[fl_year]` shortcode (which is available when
you use the Beaver Builder Theme) has been inserted to render the current year
in the output.

##  HTML settings

As you can see in the screenshot, the HTML module has a **General** tab with a
code editor and an **Advanced** tab, which has all the usual **Advanced** tab
settings for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.

There is no **Style** tab. You can style the markup in this module in the
following ways:

  * Apply inline styles in the code editor on the **General** tab
  * Apply CSS rules by adding a custom ID or class, either directly in the code editor or in the **HTML** section of the **Advanced** tab.

## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-rows-columns-modules.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
