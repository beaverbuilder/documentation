There are a couple ways to insert columns.

##  Drag a module into the layout

Dragging a module into the layout automatically creates new structure around it if necessary. For example, rather than first creating a row and then inserting a module, you can just drag and drop a module into a location on the page outside of an existing row, and a new row, column group, and column are created around the module .

In the following screenshot, an Icon module is being dragged between two other columns. The blue shading shows where the new column will be inserted.

## Drag and drop empty columns into the layout

There are times when dragging a module into the layout doesn't create the column structure you want. Particularly in these cases, you can add empty columns or nested columns anywhere and drag in the modules as a second step.

**To drag one or more empty columns into the layout:**

* In the Content panel, click the **Rows** tab and drag the column configuration you want into the layout.

If you're unable to insert new columns, check to see if you've reached the [column limit](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/column-layouts-overview.md/#column-limits).
