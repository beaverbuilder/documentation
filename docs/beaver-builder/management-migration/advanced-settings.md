## Assets

### Render css/js assets inline

Enable or disable rendering of Beaver Builder assets inline. When enabled, instead of loading Beaver Builder CSS and JavaScript as an asset file, you can render the CSS inline in the `<head>` tag and the JavaScript inline right before the closing `<body>` tag.

This can be a solution to some rare caching issues, but in most cases you donâ€™t need this enabled.

:x: Disabled by default.
