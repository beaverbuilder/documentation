## Revisions

Display the previously published revisions available to revert to. The number of revisions available is displayed in brackets. This menu item uses the core WordPress revision feature but makes it more convenient to view and access revisions. See [this article](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/restore-a-previous-version.md) for more information about restoring previous versions.

:::note **Note** 
Only published pages count as revisions. Saved drafts of pages are not available as revisions.

## Layout CSS and JavaScript

A quick way to add CSS and JavaScript that only apply to the page being edited. You can assign a custom ID or class on the Advanced tab of any row, column, or module, then use it in your CSS rule.

A green dot shows beside this menu item when custom CSS or JavaScript has already been added on the page being viewed.

## Global settings

Beaver Builder editor settings that apply as defaults. Most of these settings can be overridden on individual pages. There's also a CSS and JavaScript tab to enter CSS and JavaScript that will apply to content layout throughout your site.

A green dot displays if any custom CSS or JavaScript has been added to this menu item. Since CSS and JavaScript added here applies to all Beaver Builder pages, after you add the custom code to one page, that code and this green dot will be visible on every page.

:::note **Note** 
Use this CSS and JavaScript tab for page content layouts only. If the CSS or JavaScript applies to parts of the page controlled by the theme or a Beaver Themer layout, use **Customize > Additional CSS**.

This option is a toggle that changes the UI skin from light (default) to dark and back.
