## What is Beaver Builder?

Beaver Builder is a page builder plugin for WordPress that allows you to create custom page layouts using a drag-and-drop interface. With Beaver Builder, you can easily create professional-looking pages without the need for any coding knowledge. The plugin includes a variety of pre-designed templates and modules that you can use to add different types of content to your pages, such as images, videos, buttons, and more.

You can also customize the appearance of your pages using the plugin's built-in design options, including the ability to change colors, fonts, and other design elements. Beaver Builder is a popular choice for creating landing pages, sales pages, and other types of promotional pages on WordPress websites.
